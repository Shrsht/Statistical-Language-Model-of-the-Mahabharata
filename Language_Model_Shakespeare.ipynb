    "## About the Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Language Models (LM)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build *[statistical language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model)* using public domain books found on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Language models attempt to capture the likelihood that a given sequence of words occur in a given \"language\" (the precise term is \"corpus\" or \"corpora\"). Here, \"language\" is a broad term that, in addition to the normal usage, may mean the language of a particular author or style. As with all statistical models, the true data generating process is never known and thus we cannot know the true probability that a sequence of words will occur – however, we can estimate these probabilities via various methods, some of which are more reliable than others. For example, one might guess that the probability of a sentence is simply the product of the empirical probabilities (i.e., the number of times a word is observed in a dataset divided by the number of words in that dataset). This is one of the methods of estimating the probability of a sequence of words that you will implement in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizing Corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the probabilities of a language model from a book requires breaking up the text of book into sequences of words. This process is called *tokenization*. In reality though, the sequences are not made up entirely of words, but rather more general terms called *tokens*. In this project tokens will include not only whole words, but also punctuation and other terms. Below are a few examples of other types of tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Punctuation. For example, the period makes sense as a token, as certain words tend to end sentences (i.e. appear right before a `'.'`), while other words tend to begin sentences (i.e. appear right after a `'.'`).\n",
    "* We have special \"START\" and \"END\" tokens that begin and end every word sequence (in our case, paragraphs of words in a given book). These make sense as tokens, as certain words may tend to begin and end paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful for the tokens used to represent START and END to be single characters that can never be found in the text of the book you use to create your language model. Thus, you will use two ASCII hidden \"[control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C0_(ASCII_and_derivatives))\":\n",
    "* For START, you will use the character `'\\x02'`, which refers to the \"beginning of text\".\n",
    "* For END, you will use the character `'\\x03'`, which refers to the \"end of text\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on Checking Your Work for Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a language model, you will need to perform several steps, from data cleaning to implementing mathematical formulas. **Things will get messy, and it can be difficult to assess the correctness of your work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The doctests will include checks on the inputs and outputs of your methods.\n",
    "- The `grade.check` public notebook tests will be **more informative** than the doctests, but they still won't guarantee that your code is correct.\n",
    "- The doctests include small-enough examples that you should be able to determine the correct outputs (e.g. probabilities) by hand.\n",
    "- Run your functions on **real books** taken from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and make sure that their behavior looks correct. After selecting a book, click the \"Plain Text UTF-8\" link to find the book's text ([example](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/68085/pg68085.txt))."

NÃ¡rad.(7)\\n\\n\\nOM.(8)\\n\\n  To sainted NÃ¡rad, prince of those\\nWhose lore in words of wisdom flows.\\nWhose constant care and chief delight\\nWere Scripture and ascetic rite,\\nThe good VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki, first and best\\nOf hermit saints, these words addressed:(9)\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn all this world, I pray thee, who\\nIs virtuous, heroic, true?\\nFirm in his vows, of grateful mind,\\nTo every creature good and kind?\\nBounteous, and holy, just, and wise,\\nAlone most fair to all menâ\\x80\\x99s eyes?\\nDevoid of envy, firm, and sage,\\nWhose tranquil soul neâ\\x80\\x99er yields to rage?\\nWhom, when his warrior wrath is high,\\nDo Gods embattled fear and fly?\\nWhose noble might and gentle skill\\nThe triple world can guard from ill?\\nWho is the best of princes, he\\nWho loves his peopleâ\\x80\\x99s good to see?\\nThe store of bliss, the living mine\\nWhere brightest joys and virtues shine?\\nQueen Fortuneâ\\x80\\x99s(10) best and dearest friend,\\nWhose steps her choicest gifts attend?\\nWho may with Sun and Moon compare,\\nWith Indra,(11) Vishá¹\\x87u,(12) Fire, and Air?\\nGrant, Saint divine,(13) the boon I ask,\\nFor thee, I ween, an easy task,\\nTo whom the power is given to know\\nIf such a man breathe here below.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen NÃ¡rad, clear before whose eye\\nThe present, past, and future lie,(14)\\nMade ready answer: â\\x80\\x9cHermit, where\\nAre graces found so high and rare?\\nYet listen, and my tongue shall tell\\nIn whom alone these virtues dwell.\\nFrom old IkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s(15) line he came,\\nKnown to the world by RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s name:\\nWith soul subdued, a chief of might,\\nIn Scripture versed, in glory bright,\\nHis steps in virtueâ\\x80\\x99s paths are bent,\\nObedient, pure, and eloquent.\\nIn each emprise he wins success,\\nAnd dying foes his power confess.\\nTall and broad-shouldered, strong of limb,\\nFortune has set her mark on him.\\nGraced with a conch-shellâ\\x80\\x99s triple line,\\nHis throat displays the auspicious sign.(16)\\nHigh destiny is clear impressed\\nOn massive jaw and ample chest,\\nHis mighty shafts he truly aims,\\nAnd foemen in the battle tames.\\nDeep in the muscle, scarcely shown,\\nEmbedded lies his collar-bone.\\nHis lordly steps are firm and free,\\nHis strong arms reach below his knee;(17)\\nAll fairest graces join to deck\\nHis head, his brow, his stately neck,\\nAnd limbs in fair proportion set:\\nThe manliest form eâ\\x80\\x99er fashioned yet.\\nGraced with each high imperial mark,\\nHis skin is soft and lustrous dark.\\nLarge are his eyes that sweetly shine\\nWith majesty almost divine.\\nHis plighted word he neâ\\x80\\x99er forgets;\\nOn erring sense a watch he sets.\\nBy nature wise, his teacherâ\\x80\\x99s skill\\nHas trained him to subdue his will.\\nGood, resolute and pure, and strong,\\nHe guards mankind from scathe and wrong,\\nAnd lends his aid, and neâ\\x80\\x99er in vain,\\nThe cause of justice to maintain.\\nWell has he studied oâ\\x80\\x99er and oâ\\x80\\x99er\\nThe Vedas(18)and their kindred lore.\\nWell skilled is he the bow to draw,(19)\\nWell trained in arts and versed in law;\\nHigh-souled and meet for happy fate,\\nMost tender and compassionate;\\nThe noblest of all lordly givers,\\nWhom good men follow, as the rivers\\nFollow the King of Floods, the sea:\\nSo liberal, so just is he.\\nThe joy of Queen KauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s(20)heart,\\nIn every virtue he has part:\\nFirm as HimÃ¡layaâ\\x80\\x99s(21) snowy steep,\\nUnfathomed like the mighty deep:\\nThe peer of Vishá¹\\x87uâ\\x80\\x99s power and might,\\nAnd lovely as the Lord of Night;(22)\\nPatient as Earth, but, roused to ire,\\nFierce as the world-destroying fire;\\nIn bounty like the Lord of Gold,(23)\\nAnd Justice self in human mould.\\n\\n  With him, his best and eldest son,\\nBy all his princely virtues won\\nKing DaÅ\\x9baratha(24) willed to share\\nHis kingdom as the Regent Heir.\\nBut when KaikeyÃ\\xad, youngest queen,\\nWith eyes of envious hate had seen\\nThe solemn pomp and regal state\\nPrepared the prince to consecrate,\\nShe bade the hapless king bestow\\nTwo gifts he promised long ago,\\nThat RÃ¡ma to the woods should flee,\\nAnd that her child the heir should be.\\n\\n  By chains of duty firmly tied,\\nThe wretched king perforce complied.\\nRÃ¡ma, to please KaikeyÃ\\xad went\\nObedient forth to banishment.\\nThen Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s truth was nobly shown,\\nThen were his love and courage known,\\nWhen for his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s sake he dared\\nAll perils, and his exile shared.\\nAnd SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s darling wife,\\nLoved even as he loved his life,\\nWhom happy marks combined to bless,\\nA miracle of loveliness,\\nOf Janakâ\\x80\\x99s royal lineage sprung,\\nMost excellent of women, clung\\nTo her dear lord, like Rohiá¹\\x87Ã\\xad\\nRejoicing with the Moon to be.(25)\\nThe King and people, sad of mood,\\nThe heroâ\\x80\\x99s car awhile pursued.\\nBut when Prince RÃ¡ma lighted down\\nAt Å\\x9aringaveraâ\\x80\\x99s pleasant town,\\nWhere GangÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s holy waters flow,\\nHe bade his driver turn and go.\\nGuha, NishÃ¡dasâ\\x80\\x99 king, he met,\\nAnd on the farther bank was set.\\nThen on from wood to wood they strayed,\\nOâ\\x80\\x99er many a stream, through constant shade,\\nAs BharadvÃ¡ja bade them, till\\nThey came to ChitrakÃºá¹\\xadaâ\\x80\\x99s hill.\\nAnd RÃ¡ma there, with Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s aid,\\nA pleasant little cottage made,\\nAnd spent his days with SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, dressed\\nIn coat of bark and deerskin vest.(26)\\nAnd ChitrakÃºá¹\\xada grew to be\\nAs bright with those illustrious three\\nAs Meruâ\\x80\\x99s(27) sacred peaks that shine\\nWith glory, when the Gods recline\\nBeneath them: Å\\x9aivaâ\\x80\\x99s(28) self between\\nThe Lord of Gold and Beautyâ\\x80\\x99s Queen.\\n\\n  The aged king for RÃ¡ma pined,\\nAnd for the skies the earth resigned.\\nBharat, his son, refused to reign,\\nThough urged by all the twice-born(29) train.\\nForth to the woods he fared to meet\\nHis brother, fell before his feet,\\nAnd cried, â\\x80\\x9cThy claim all men allow:\\nO come, our lord and king be thou.â\\x80\\x9d\\nBut RÃ¡ma nobly chose to be\\nObservant of his sireâ\\x80\\x99s decree.\\nHe placed his sandals(30) in his hand\\nA pledge that he would rule the land:\\nAnd bade his brother turn again.\\nThen Bharat, finding prayer was vain,\\nThe sandals took and went away;\\nNor in AyodhyÃ¡ would he stay.\\nBut turned to NandigrÃ¡ma, where\\nHe ruled the realm with watchful care,\\nStill longing eagerly to learn\\nTidings of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s safe return.\\n\\n  Then lest the people should repeat\\nTheir visit to his calm retreat,\\nAway from ChitrakÃºá¹\\xadaâ\\x80\\x99s hill\\nFared RÃ¡ma ever onward till\\nBeneath the shady trees he stood\\nOf Daá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dakÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s primeval wood,\\nVirÃ¡dha, giant fiend, he slew,\\nAnd then Agastyaâ\\x80\\x99s friendship knew.\\nCounselled by him he gained the sword\\nAnd bow of Indra, heavenly lord:\\nA pair of quivers too, that bore\\nOf arrows an exhaustless store.\\nWhile there he dwelt in greenwood shade\\nThe trembling hermits sought his aid,\\nAnd bade him with his sword and bow\\nDestroy the fiends who worked them woe:\\nTo come like Indra strong and brave,\\nA guardian God to help and save.\\nAnd RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s falchion left its trace\\nDeep cut on Å\\x9aÃºrpaá¹\\x87akhÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s face:\\nA hideous giantess who came\\nBurning for him with lawless flame.\\nTheir sisterâ\\x80\\x99s cries the giants heard.\\nAnd vengeance in each bosom stirred:\\nThe monster of the triple head.\\nAnd DÃºshaá¹\\x87 to the contest sped.\\nBut they and myriad fiends beside\\nBeneath the might of RÃ¡ma died.\\n\\n  When RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87, dreaded warrior, knew\\nThe slaughter of his giant crew:\\nRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87, the king, whose name of fear\\nEarth, hell, and heaven all shook to hear:\\nHe bade the fiend MÃ¡rÃ\\xadcha aid\\nThe vengeful plot his fury laid.\\nIn vain the wise MÃ¡rÃ\\xadcha tried\\nTo turn him from his course aside:\\nNot RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s self, he said, might hope\\nWith RÃ¡ma and his strength to cope.\\nImpelled by fate and blind with rage\\nHe came to RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s hermitage.\\nThere, by MÃ¡rÃ\\xadchaâ\\x80\\x99s magic art,\\nHe wiled the princely youths apart,\\nThe vulture(31) slew, and bore away\\nThe wife of RÃ¡ma as his prey.\\nThe son of Raghu(32) came and found\\nJaá¹\\xadÃ¡yu slain upon the ground.\\nHe rushed within his leafy cot;\\nHe sought his wife, but found her not.\\nThen, then the heroâ\\x80\\x99s senses failed;\\nIn mad despair he wept and wailed.\\nUpon the pile that bird he laid,\\nAnd still in quest of SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ strayed.\\nA hideous giant then he saw,\\nKabandha named, a shape of awe.\\nThe monstrous fiend he smote and slew,\\nAnd in the flame the body threw;\\nWhen straight from out the funeral flame\\nIn lovely form Kabandha came,\\nAnd bade him seek in his distress\\nA wise and holy hermitess.\\nBy counsel of this saintly dame\\nTo PampÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s pleasant flood he came,\\nAnd there the steadfast friendship won\\nOf HanumÃ¡n the Wind-Godâ\\x80\\x99s son.\\nCounselled by him he told his grief\\nTo great SugrÃ\\xadva, VÃ¡nar chief,\\nWho, knowing all the tale, before\\nThe sacred flame alliance swore.\\nSugrÃ\\xadva to his new-found friend\\nTold his own story to the end:\\nHis hate of BÃ¡li for the wrong\\nAnd insult he had borne so long.\\nAnd RÃ¡ma lent a willing ear\\nAnd promised to allay his fear.\\nSugrÃ\\xadva warned him of the might\\nOf BÃ¡li, matchless in the fight,\\nAnd, credence for his tale to gain,\\nShowed the huge fiend(33) by BÃ¡li slain.\\nThe prostrate corse of mountain size\\nSeemed nothing in the heroâ\\x80\\x99s eyes;\\nHe lightly kicked it, as it lay,\\nAnd cast it twenty leagues(34) away.\\nTo prove his might his arrows through\\nSeven palms in line, uninjured, flew.\\nHe cleft a mighty hill apart,\\nAnd down to hell he hurled his dart.\\nThen high SugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s spirit rose,\\nAssured of conquest oâ\\x80\\x99er his foes.\\nWith his new champion by his side\\nTo vast KishkindhÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s cave he hied.\\nThen, summoned by his awful shout,\\nKing BÃ¡li came in fury out,\\nFirst comforted his trembling wife,\\nThen sought SugrÃ\\xadva in the strife.\\nOne shaft from RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s deadly bow\\nThe monarch in the dust laid low.\\nThen RÃ¡ma bade SugrÃ\\xadva reign\\nIn place of royal BÃ¡li slain.\\nThen speedy envoys hurried forth\\nEastward and westward, south and north,\\nCommanded by the grateful king\\nTidings of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s spouse to bring.\\n\\n  Then by SampÃ¡tiâ\\x80\\x99s counsel led,\\nBrave HanumÃ¡n, who mocked at dread,\\nSprang at one wild tremendous leap\\nTwo hundred leagues across the deep.\\nTo LankÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s(35) town he urged his way,\\nWhere RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 held his royal sway.\\nThere pensive â\\x80\\x99neath AÅ\\x9boka(36) boughs\\nHe found poor SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s spouse.\\nHe gave the hapless girl a ring,\\nA token from her lord and king.\\nA pledge from her fair hand he bore;\\nThen battered down the garden door.\\nFive captains of the host he slew,\\nSeven sons of councillors oâ\\x80\\x99erthrew;\\nCrushed youthful Aksha on the field,\\nThen to his captors chose to yield.\\nSoon from their bonds his limbs were free,\\nBut honouring the high decree\\nWhich BrahmÃ¡(37) had pronounced of yore,\\nHe calmly all their insults bore.\\nThe town he burnt with hostile flame,\\nAnd spoke again with RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s dame,\\nThen swiftly back to RÃ¡ma flew\\nWith tidings of the interview.\\n\\n  Then with SugrÃ\\xadva for his guide,\\nCame RÃ¡ma to the ocean side.\\nHe smote the sea with shafts as bright\\nAs sunbeams in their summer height,\\nAnd quick appeared the Riversâ\\x80\\x99 King(38)\\nObedient to the summoning.\\nA bridge was thrown by Nala oâ\\x80\\x99er\\nThe narrow sea from shore to shore.(39)\\nThey crossed to LankÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s golden town,\\nWhere RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s hand smote RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 down.\\nVibhishaá¹\\x87 there was left to reign\\nOver his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s wide domain.\\nTo meet her husband SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ came;\\nBut RÃ¡ma, stung with ire and shame,\\nWith bitter words his wife addressed\\nBefore the crowd that round her pressed.\\nBut SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, touched with noble ire,\\nGave her fair body to the fire.\\nThen straight the God of Wind appeared,\\nAnd words from heaven her honour cleared.\\nAnd RÃ¡ma clasped his wife again,\\nUninjured, pure from spot and stain,\\nObedient to the Lord of Fire\\nAnd the high mandate of his sire.\\nLed by the Lord who rules the sky,\\nThe Gods and heavenly saints drew nigh,\\nAnd honoured him with worthy meed,\\nRejoicing in each glorious deed.\\nHis task achieved, his foe removed,\\nHe triumphed, by the Gods approved.\\nBy grace of Heaven he raised to life\\nThe chieftains slain in mortal strife;\\nThen in the magic chariot through\\nThe clouds to NandigrÃ¡ma flew.\\nMet by his faithful brothers there,\\nHe loosed his votive coil of hair:\\nThence fair AyodhyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s town he gained,\\nAnd oâ\\x80\\x99er his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s kingdom reigned.\\nDisease or famine neâ\\x80\\x99er oppressed\\nHis happy people, richly blest\\nWith all the joys of ample wealth,\\nOf sweet content and perfect health.\\nNo widow mourned her well-loved mate,\\nNo sire his sonâ\\x80\\x99s untimely fate.\\nThey feared not storm or robberâ\\x80\\x99s hand;\\nNo fire or flood laid waste the land:\\nThe Golden Age(40) had come again\\nTo bless the days of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s reign.\\n\\n  From him, the great and glorious king,\\nShall many a princely scion spring.\\nAnd he shall rule, beloved by men,\\nTen thousand years and hundreds ten,(41)\\nAnd when his life on earth is past\\nTo BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s world shall go at last.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Whoeâ\\x80\\x99er this noble poem reads\\nThat tells the tale of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s deeds,\\nGood as the Scriptures, he shall be\\nFrom every sin and blemish free.\\nWhoever reads the saving strain,\\nWith all his kin the heavens shall gain.\\nBrÃ¡hmans who read shall gather hence\\nThe highest praise for eloquence.\\nThe warrior, oâ\\x80\\x99er the land shall reign,\\nThe merchant, luck in trade obtain;\\nAnd Å\\x9aÃºdras listening(42) neâ\\x80\\x99er shall fail\\nTo reap advantage from the tale.(43)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto II. BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s Visit\\n\\n\\nVÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki, graceful speaker, heard,\\nTo highest admiration stirred.\\nTo him whose fame the tale rehearsed\\nHe paid his mental worship first;\\nThen with his pupil humbly bent\\nBefore the saint most eloquent.\\nThus honoured and dismissed the seer\\nDeparted to his heavenly sphere.\\nThen from his cot VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki hied\\nTo TamasÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s(44) sequestered side,\\nNot far remote from GangÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s tide.\\nHe stood and saw the ripples roll\\nPellucid oâ\\x80\\x99er a pebbly shoal.\\nTo BharadvÃ¡ja(45) by his side\\nHe turned in ecstasy, and cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee, pupil dear, this lovely sight,\\nThe smooth-floored shallow, pure and bright,\\nWith not a speck or shade to mar,\\nAnd clear as good menâ\\x80\\x99s bosoms are.\\nHere on the brink thy pitcher lay,\\nAnd bring my zone of bark, I pray.\\nHere will I bathe: the rill has not,\\nTo lave the limbs, a fairer spot.\\nDo quickly as I bid, nor waste\\nThe precious time; away, and haste.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Obedient to his masterâ\\x80\\x99s hest\\nQuick from the cot he brought the vest;\\nThe hermit took it from his hand,\\nAnd tightened round his waist the band;\\nThen duly dipped and bathed him there,\\nAnd muttered low his secret prayer.\\nTo spirits and to Gods he made\\nLibation of the stream, and strayed\\nViewing the forest deep and wide\\nThat spread its shade on every side.\\nClose by the bank he saw a pair\\nOf curlews sporting fearless there.\\nBut suddenly with evil mind\\nAn outcast fowler stole behind,\\nAnd, with an aim too sure and true,\\nThe male bird near the hermit slew.\\nThe wretched hen in wild despair\\nWith fluttering pinions beat the air,\\nAnd shrieked a long and bitter cry\\nWhen low on earth she saw him lie,\\nHer loved companion, quivering, dead,\\nHis dear wings with his lifeblood red;\\nAnd for her golden crested mate\\nShe mourned, and was disconsolate.\\n\\n  The hermit saw the slaughtered bird,\\nAnd all his heart with ruth was stirred.\\nThe fowlerâ\\x80\\x99s impious deed distressed\\nHis gentle sympathetic breast,\\nAnd while the curlewâ\\x80\\x99s sad cries rang\\nWithin his ears, the hermit sang:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo fame be thine for endless time,\\nBecause, base outcast, of thy crime,\\nWhose cruel hand was fain to slay\\nOne of this gentle pair at play!â\\x80\\x9d\\nEâ\\x80\\x99en as he spoke his bosom wrought\\nAnd laboured with the wondering thought\\nWhat was the speech his ready tongue\\nHad uttered when his heart was wrung.\\nHe pondered long upon the speech,\\nRecalled the words and measured each,\\nAnd thus exclaimed the saintly guide\\nTo BharadvÃ¡ja by his side:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith equal lines of even feet,\\nWith rhythm and time and tone complete,\\nThe measured form of words I spoke\\nIn shock of grief be termed a Å\\x9bloke.â\\x80\\x9d(46)\\nAnd BharadvÃ¡ja, nothing slow\\nHis faithful love and zeal to show,\\nAnswered those words of wisdom, â\\x80\\x9cBe\\nThe name, my lord, as pleases thee.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  As rules prescribe the hermit took\\nSome lustral water from the brook.\\nBut still on this his constant thought\\nKept brooding, as his home he sought;\\nWhile BharadvÃ¡ja paced behind,\\nA pupil sage of lowly mind,\\nAnd in his hand a pitcher bore\\nWith pure fresh water brimming oâ\\x80\\x99er.\\nSoon as they reached their calm retreat\\nThe holy hermit took his seat;\\nHis mind from worldly cares recalled,\\nAnd mused in deepest thought enthralled.\\n\\n  Then glorious BrahmÃ¡,(47) Lord Most High,\\nCreator of the earth and sky,\\nThe four-faced God, to meet the sage\\nCame to VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadkiâ\\x80\\x99s hermitage.\\nSoon as the mighty God he saw,\\nUp sprang the saint in wondering awe.\\nMute, with clasped hands, his head he bent,\\nAnd stood before him reverent.\\nHis honoured guest he greeted well,\\nWho bade him of his welfare tell;\\nGave water for his blessed feet,\\nBrought offerings,(48) and prepared a seat.\\nIn honoured place the God Most High\\nSate down, and bade the saint sit nigh.\\nThere sate before VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadkiâ\\x80\\x99s eyes\\nThe Father of the earth and skies;\\nBut still the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts were bent\\nOn one thing only, all intent\\nOn that poor curlewâ\\x80\\x99s mournful fate\\nLamenting for her slaughtered mate;\\nAnd still his lips, in absent mood,\\nThe verse that told his grief, renewed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWoe to the fowlerâ\\x80\\x99s impious hand\\nThat did the deed that folly planned;\\nThat could to needless death devote\\nThe curlew of the tuneful throat!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The heavenly Father smiled in glee,\\nAnd said, â\\x80\\x9cO best of hermits, see,\\nA verse, unconscious, thou hast made;\\nNo longer be the task delayed.\\nSeek not to trace, with labour vain,\\nThe unpremeditated strain.\\nThe tuneful lines thy lips rehearsed\\nSpontaneous from thy bosom burst.\\nThen come, O best of seers, relate\\nThe life of RÃ¡ma good and great,\\nThe tale that saintly NÃ¡rad told,\\nIn all its glorious length unfold.\\nOf all the deeds his arm has done\\nUpon this earth, omit not one,\\nAnd thus the noble life record\\nOf that wise, brave, and virtuous lord.\\nHis every act to day displayed,\\nHis secret life to none betrayed:\\nHow Lakshmaá¹\\x87, how the giants fought;\\nWith high emprise and hidden thought:\\nAnd all that Janakâ\\x80\\x99s child(49) befell\\nWhere all could see, where none could tell.\\nThe whole of this shall truly be\\nMade known, O best of saints, to thee.\\nIn all thy poem, through my grace,\\nNo word of falsehood shall have place.\\nBegin the story, and rehearse\\nThe tale divine in charming verse.\\nAs long as in this firm-set land\\nThe streams shall flow, the mountains stand,\\nSo long throughout the world, be sure,\\nThe great RÃ¡mÃ¡yan shall endure.(50)\\nWhile the RÃ¡mÃ¡yanâ\\x80\\x99s ancient strain\\nShall glorious in the earth remain,\\nTo higher spheres shalt thou arise\\nAnd dwell with me above the skies.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He spoke, and vanished into air,\\nAnd left VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki wondering there.\\nThe pupils of the holy man,\\nMoved by their love of him, began\\nTo chant that verse, and ever more\\nThey marvelled as they sang it oâ\\x80\\x99er:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBehold, the four-lined balanced rime,\\nRepeated over many a time,\\nIn words that from the hermit broke\\nIn shock of grief, becomes a Å\\x9bloke.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThis measure now VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki chose\\nWherein his story to compose.\\nIn hundreds of such verses, sweet\\nWith equal lines and even feet,\\nThe saintly poet, lofty-souled,\\nThe glorious deeds of RÃ¡ma told.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto III. The Argument.\\n\\n\\nThe hermit thus with watchful heed\\nReceived the poemâ\\x80\\x99s pregnant seed,\\nAnd looked with eager thought around\\nIf fuller knowledge might be found.\\nHis lips with water first bedewed,(51)\\nHe sate, in reverent attitude\\nOn holy grass,(52) the points all bent\\nTogether toward the orient;(53)\\nAnd thus in meditation he\\nEntered the path of poesy.\\nThen clearly, through his virtueâ\\x80\\x99s might,\\nAll lay discovered to his sight,\\nWhateâ\\x80\\x99er befell, through all their life,\\nRÃ¡ma, his brother, and his wife:\\nAnd DaÅ\\x9baratha and each queen\\nAt every time, in every scene:\\nHis people too, of every sort;\\nThe nobles of his princely court:\\nWhateâ\\x80\\x99er was said, whateâ\\x80\\x99er decreed,\\nEach time they sate each plan and deed:\\nFor holy thought and fervent rite\\nHad so refined his keener sight\\nThat by his sanctity his view\\nThe present, past, and future knew,\\nAnd he with mental eye could grasp,\\nLike fruit within his fingers clasp,\\nThe life of RÃ¡ma, great and good,\\nRoaming with SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ in the wood.\\nHe told, with secret-piercing eyes,\\nThe tale of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s high emprise,\\nEach listening ear that shall entice,\\nA sea of pearls of highest price.\\nThus good VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki, sage divine,\\nRehearsed the tale of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s line,\\nAs NÃ¡rad, heavenly saint, before\\nHad traced the storyâ\\x80\\x99s outline oâ\\x80\\x99er.\\nHe sang of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s princely birth,\\nHis kindness and heroic worth;\\nHis love for all, his patient youth,\\nHis gentleness and constant truth,\\nAnd many a tale and legend old\\nBy holy ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra told.\\nHow Janakâ\\x80\\x99s child he wooed and won,\\nAnd broke the bow that bent to none.\\nHow he with every virtue fraught\\nHis namesake RÃ¡ma(54) met and fought.\\nThe choice of RÃ¡ma for the throne;\\nThe malice by KaikeyÃ\\xad shown,\\nWhose evil counsel marred the plan\\nAnd drove him forth a banisht man.\\nHow the king grieved and groaned, and cried,\\nAnd swooned away and pining died.\\nThe subjectsâ\\x80\\x99 woe when thus bereft;\\nAnd how the following crowds he left:\\nWith Guha talked, and firmly stern\\nOrdered his driver to return.\\nHow GangÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s farther shore he gained;\\nBy BharadvÃ¡ja entertained,\\nBy whose advice he journeyed still\\nAnd came to ChitrakÃºá¹\\xadaâ\\x80\\x99s hill.\\nHow there he dwelt and built a cot;\\nHow Bharat journeyed to the spot;\\nHis earnest supplication made;\\nDrink-offerings to their father paid;\\nThe sandals given by RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s hand,\\nAs emblems of his right, to stand:\\nHow from his presence Bharat went\\nAnd years in NandigrÃ¡ma spent.\\nHow RÃ¡ma entered Daá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dak wood\\nAnd in SutÃ\\xadkhá¹\\x87aâ\\x80\\x99s presence stood.\\nThe favour AnasÃºyÃ¡ showed,\\nThe wondrous balsam she bestowed.\\nHow Å\\x9aarabhangaâ\\x80\\x99s dwelling-place\\nThey sought;

his foes\\n  That night at home he spent.\\nAnd when the morrowâ\\x80\\x99s sun arose\\nForth to the forest went.\\n  But RishyaÅ\\x9bring with eager pace\\nSped forth and hurried to the place\\nWhere he those visitants had seen\\nOf daintly waist and charming mien.\\nWhen from afar they saw the son\\nOf Saint VibhÃ¡á¹\\x87dak toward them run,\\nTo meet the hermit boy they hied,\\nAnd hailed him with a smile, and cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO come, we pray, dear lord, behold\\nOur lovely home of which we told\\nDue honour there to thee weâ\\x80\\x99ll pay,\\nAnd speed thee on thy homeward way.â\\x80\\x9d\\nPleased with the gracious words they said\\nHe followed where the damsels led.\\nAs with his guides his steps he bent,\\n  That BrÃ¡hman high of worth,\\nA flood of rain from heaven was sent\\n  That gladdened all the earth.\\n\\n  VibhÃ¡á¹\\x87dak took his homeward road,\\nAnd wearied by the heavy load\\nOf roots and woodland fruit he bore\\nEntered at last his cottage door.\\nFain for his son he looked around,\\nBut desolate the cell he found.\\nHe stayed not then to bathe his feet,\\nThough fainting with the toil and heat,\\nBut hurried forth and roamed about\\nCalling the boy with cry and shout,\\nHe searched the wood, but all in vain;\\nNor tidings of his son could gain.\\n\\n  One day beyond the forestâ\\x80\\x99s bound\\nThe wandering saint a village found,\\nAnd asked the swains and neatherds there\\nWho owned the land so rich and fair,\\nWith all the hamlets of the plain,\\nAnd herds of kine and fields of grain.\\nThey listened to the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s words,\\nAnd all the guardians of the herds,\\nWith suppliant hands together pressed,\\nThis answer to the saint addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Angasâ\\x80\\x99 lord who bears the name\\nOf LomapÃ¡d, renowned by fame,\\nBestowed these hamlets with their kine\\nAnd all their riches, as a sign\\nOf grace, on RishyaÅ\\x9bring: and he\\nVibhÃ¡á¹\\x87dakâ\\x80\\x99s son is said to be.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThe hermit with exulting breast\\nThe mighty will of fate confessed,\\nBy meditationâ\\x80\\x99s eye discerned;\\nAnd cheerful to his home returned.\\n\\n  A stately ship, at early morn,\\nThe hermitâ\\x80\\x99s son away had borne.\\nLoud roared the clouds, as on he sped,\\nThe sky grew blacker overhead;\\nTill, as he reached the royal town,\\nA mighty flood of rain came down.\\nBy the great rain the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s mind\\nThe coming of his guest divined.\\nTo meet the honoured youth he went,\\nAnd low to earth his head he bent.\\nWith his own priest to lead the train,\\nHe gave the gift high guests obtain.\\nAnd sought, with all who dwelt within\\nThe city walls, his grace to win.\\nHe fed him with the daintiest fare,\\nHe served him with unceasing care,\\nAnd ministered with anxious eyes\\nLest anger in his breast should rise;\\nAnd gave to be the BrÃ¡hmanâ\\x80\\x99s bride\\nHis own fair daughter, lotus-eyed.\\n\\n  Thus loved and honoured by the king,\\nThe glorious BrÃ¡hman RishyaÅ\\x9bring\\nPassed in that royal town his life\\nWith Å\\x9aÃ¡ntÃ¡ his beloved wife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto X. Rishyasring Invited.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAgain, O best of kings, give ear:\\nMy saving words attentive hear,\\nAnd listen to the tale of old\\nBy that illustrious BrÃ¡hman told.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf famed IkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s line shall spring\\n(â\\x80\\x99Twas thus he spoke) a pious king,\\nNamed DaÅ\\x9baratha, good and great,\\nTrue to his word and fortunate.\\nHe with the Angasâ\\x80\\x99 mighty lord\\nShall ever live in sweet accord,\\nAnd his a daughter fair shall be,\\nÅ\\x9aÃ¡ntÃ¡ of happy destiny.\\nBut LomapÃ¡d, the Angasâ\\x80\\x99 chief,\\nStill pining in his childless grief,\\nTo DaÅ\\x9baratha thus shall say:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGive me thy daughter, friend, I pray,\\nThy Å\\x9aÃ¡ntÃ¡ of the tranquil mind,\\nThe noblest one of womankind.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The father, swift to feel for woe,\\nShall on his friend his child bestow;\\nAnd he shall take her and depart\\nTo his own town with joyous heart.\\nThe maiden home in triumph led,\\nTo RishyaÅ\\x9bring the king shall wed.\\nAnd he with loving joy and pride\\nShall take her for his honoured bride.\\nAnd DaÅ\\x9baratha to a rite\\nThat best of BrÃ¡hmans shall invite\\n  With supplicating prayer,\\nTo celebrate the sacrifice\\nTo win him sons and Paradise,(83)\\nThat he will fain prepare.\\nFrom him the lord of men at length\\n  The boon he seeks shall gain,\\nAnd see four sons of boundless strength\\n  His royal line maintain.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThus did the godlike saint of old\\n  The will of fate declare,\\nAnd all that should befall unfold\\n  Amid the sages there.\\nO Prince supreme of men, go thou,\\n  Consult thy holy guide,\\nAnd win, to aid thee in thy vow,\\n  This BrÃ¡hman to thy side.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSumantraâ\\x80\\x99s counsel, wise and good,\\n  King DaÅ\\x9baratha heard,\\nThen by VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadhaâ\\x80\\x99s side he stood\\nAnd thus with him conferred:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSumantra counsels thus: do thou\\nMy priestly guide, the plan allow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n  VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha gave his glad consent,\\nAnd forth the happy monarch went\\nWith lords and servants on the road\\nThat led to RishyaÅ\\x9bringâ\\x80\\x99s abode.\\nForests and rivers duly past,\\nHe reached the distant town at last\\nOf LomapÃ¡d the Angasâ\\x80\\x99 king,\\nAnd entered it with welcoming.\\nOn through the crowded streets he came,\\nAnd, radiant as the kindled flame,\\nHe saw within the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s house\\nThe hermitâ\\x80\\x99s son most glorious.\\nThere LomapÃ¡d, with joyful breast,\\n  To him all honour paid,\\nFor friendship for his royal guest\\n  His faithful bosom swayed.\\nThus entertained with utmost care\\nSeven days, or eight, he tarried there,\\nAnd then that best of men thus broke\\nHis purpose to the king, and spoke:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO King of men, mine ancient friend,\\n  (Thus DaÅ\\x9baratha prayed)\\nThy Å\\x9aÃ¡ntÃ¡ with her husband send\\n  My sacrifice to aid.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSaid he who ruled the Angas, Yea,\\n  And his consent was won:\\nAnd then at once he turned away\\n  To warn the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s son.\\nHe told him of their ties beyond\\nTheir old affectionâ\\x80\\x99s faithful bond:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis king,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cfrom days of old\\nA well beloved friend I hold.\\nTo me this pearl of dames he gave\\nFrom childless woe mine age to save,\\nThe daughter whom he loved so much,\\nMoved by compassionâ\\x80\\x99s gentle touch.\\nIn him thy Å\\x9aÃ¡ntÃ¡s father see:\\nAs I am even so is he.\\nFor sons the childless monarch yearns:\\nTo thee alone for help he turns.\\nGo thou, the sacred rite ordain\\nTo win the sons he prays to gain:\\nGo, with thy wife thy succour lend,\\nAnd give his vows a blissful end.â\\x80\\x9d\\n  The hermitâ\\x80\\x99s son with quick accord\\nObeyed the Angasâ\\x80\\x99 mighty lord,\\nAnd with fair Å\\x9aÃ¡ntÃ¡ at his side\\nTo DaÅ\\x9barathaâ\\x80\\x99s city hied.\\nEach king, with suppliant hands upheld,\\n  Gazed on the otherâ\\x80\\x99s face:\\nAnd then by mutual love impelled\\n  Met in a close embrace.\\nThen DaÅ\\x9barathaâ\\x80\\x99s thoughtful care,\\n  Before he parted thence,\\nBade trusty servants homeward bear\\n  The glad intelligence:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet all the town be bright and gay\\n  With burning incense sweet;\\nLet banners wave, and water lay\\n  The dust in every street.â\\x80\\x9d\\nGlad were the citizens to learn\\nThe tidings of their lordâ\\x80\\x99s return,\\nAnd through the city every man\\nObediently his task began.\\nAnd fair and bright AyodhyÃ¡ showed,\\nAs following his guest he rode\\nThrough the full streets where shell and drum\\nProclaimed aloud the king was come.\\nAnd all the people with delight\\n  Kept gazing on their king,\\nAttended by that youth so bright,\\n  The glorious RishyaÅ\\x9bring.\\nWhen to his home the king had brought\\n  The hermitâ\\x80\\x99s saintly son,\\nHe deemed that all his task was wrought,\\n  And all he prayed for won.\\nAnd lords who saw that stranger dame\\n  So beautiful to view,\\nRejoiced within their hearts, and came\\n  And paid her honour too.\\nThere RishyaÅ\\x9bring passed blissful days,\\nGraced like the king with love and praise\\nAnd shone in glorious light with her,\\nSweet Å\\x9aÃ¡ntÃ¡, for his minister,\\nAs BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s son VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha, he\\nWho wedded Saint ArundhatÃ\\xad.(84)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XI. The Sacrifice Decreed.\\n\\n\\nThe Dewy Season(85) came and went;\\n  The spring returned again:\\nThen would the king, with mind intent,\\n  His sacrifice ordain.\\nHe came to RishyaÅ\\x9bring, and bowed\\n  To him of look divine,\\nAnd bade him aid his offering vowed\\n  For heirs, to save his line.\\nNor would the youth his aid deny:\\n  He spake the monarch fair,\\nAnd prayed him for that rite so high\\n  All requisites prepare.\\nThe king to wise Sumantra cried\\n  Who stood aye ready near;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo summon quick each holy guide,\\n  To counsel and to hear.â\\x80\\x9d\\nObedient to his lordâ\\x80\\x99s behest\\n  Away Sumantra sped,\\nAnd brought VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha and the rest,\\n  In Scripture deeply read.\\nSuyajÇ¹a, VÃ¡madeva came,\\n  JÃ¡vali, KaÅ\\x9byapâ\\x80\\x99s son,\\nAnd old VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha, dear to fame,\\n  Obedient every one.\\nKing DaÅ\\x9baratha met them there\\n  And duly honoured each,\\nAnd spoke in pleasant words his fair\\n  And salutary speech:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn childless longing doomed to pine,\\nNo happiness, O lords, is mine.\\nSo have I for this cause decreed\\nTo slay the sacrificial steed.\\nFain would I pay that offering high\\nWherein the horse is doomed to die,\\nWith RishyaÅ\\x9bring his aid to lend,\\nAnd with your glory to befriend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n  With loud applause each holy man\\nReceived his speech, approved the plan,\\nAnd, by the wise VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha led,\\nGave praises to the king, and said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe sons thou cravest shalt thou see,\\nOf fairest glory, born to thee,\\nWhose holy feelings bid thee take\\nThis righteous course for offspringâ\\x80\\x99s sake.â\\x80\\x9d\\nCheered by the ready praise of those\\nWhose aid he sought, his spirits rose,\\nAnd thus the king his speech renewed\\nWith looks of joy and gratitude:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet what the coming rites require\\nBe ready as the priests desire,\\nAnd let the horse, ordained to bleed,\\nWith fitting guard and priest, be freed,(86)\\nYonder on SarjÃºâ\\x80\\x99s northern side\\nThe sacrificial ground provide;\\nAnd let the saving rites, that naught\\nIll-omened may occur, be wrought.\\nThe offering I announce to-day\\nEach lord of earth may claim to pay,\\nProvided that his care can guard\\nThe holy rite by flaws unmarred.\\nFor wandering fiends, whose watchful spite\\nWaits eagerly to spoil each rite,\\nHunting with keenest eye detect\\nThe slightest slip, the least neglect;\\nAnd when the sacred work is crossed\\nThe workman is that moment lost.\\nLet preparation due be made:\\n  Your powers the charge can meet:\\nThat so the noble rite be paid\\n  In every point complete.â\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd all the BrÃ¡hmans answered, Yea,\\n  His mandate honouring,\\nAnd gladly promised to obey\\n  The order of the king.\\nThey cried with voices raised aloud:\\n  â\\x80\\x9cSuccess attend thine aim!â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen bade farewell, and lowly bowed,\\n  And hastened whence they came.\\nKing DaÅ\\x9baratha went within,\\n  His well loved wives to see:\\nAnd said: â\\x80\\x9cYour lustral rites begin,\\n  For these shall prosper me.\\nA glorious offering I prepare\\nThat precious fruit of sons may bear.â\\x80\\x9d\\nTheir lily faces brightened fast\\n  Those pleasant words to hear,\\nAs lilies, when the winterâ\\x80\\x99s past,\\nIn lovelier hues appear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XII. The Sacrifice Begun.\\n\\n\\nAgain the spring with genial heat\\nReturning made the year complete.\\nTo win him sons, without delay\\nHis vow the king resolved to pay:\\nAnd to VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha, saintly man,\\nIn modest words this speech began:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrepare the rite with all things fit\\nAs is ordained in Holy Writ,\\nAnd keep with utmost care afar\\nWhateâ\\x80\\x99er its sacred forms might mar.\\nThou art, my lord, my trustiest guide,\\nKind-hearted, and my friend beside;\\nSo is it meet thou undertake\\nThis heavy task for dutyâ\\x80\\x99s sake.â\\x80\\x9d\\n  Then he, of twice-born men the best,\\nHis glad assent at once expressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFain will I do whateâ\\x80\\x99er may be\\nDesired, O honoured King, by thee.â\\x80\\x9d\\nTo ancient priests he spoke, who, trained\\nIn holy rites, deep skill had gained:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere guards be stationed, good and sage\\nReligious men of trusted age.\\nAnd various workmen send and call,\\nWho frame the door and build the wall:\\nWith men of every art and trade,\\nWho read the stars and ply the spade,\\nAnd mimes and minstrels hither bring,\\nAnd damsels trained to dance and sing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n  Then to the learned men he said,\\nIn many a page of Scripture read:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe yours each rite performed to see\\nAccording to the kingâ\\x80\\x99s decree.\\nAnd stranger BrÃ¡hmans quickly call\\nTo this great rite that welcomes all.\\nPavilions for the princes, decked\\nWith art and ornament, erect,\\nAnd handsome booths by thousands made\\nThe BrÃ¡hman visitors to shade,\\nArranged in order side by side,\\nWith meat and drink and all supplied.\\nAnd ample stables we shall need\\nFor many an elephant and steed:\\nAnd chambers where the men may lie,\\nAnd vast apartments, broad and high,\\nFit to receive the countless bands\\nOf warriors come from distant lands.\\nFor our own people too provide\\nSufficient tents, extended wide,\\nAnd stores of meat and drink prepare,\\nAnd all that can be needed there.\\nAnd food in plenty must be found\\nFor guests from all the country round.\\nOf various viands presents make,\\nFor honour, not for pityâ\\x80\\x99s sake,\\nThat fit regard and worship be\\nPaid to each caste in due degree.\\nAnd let not wish or wrath excite\\nYour hearts the meanest guest to slight;\\nBut still observe with special grace\\nThose who obtain the foremost place,\\nWhether for happier skill in art\\nOr bearing in the rite their part.\\nDo you, I pray, with friendly mind\\nPerform the task to you assigned,\\nAnd work the rite, as bids the law,\\nWithout omission, slip, or flawâ\\x80\\x9d\\n  They answered: â\\x80\\x9cAs thou seest fit\\nSo will we do and naught omit.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThe sage VaÅ\\x9biá¹£á¹\\xadha then addressed\\nSumantra called at his behest:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe princes of the earth invite,\\nAnd famous lords who guard the rite,\\nPriest, Warrior, Merchant, lowly thrall,\\nIn countless thousands summon all.\\nWhereâ\\x80\\x99er their home be, far or near,\\nGather the good with honour here,\\nAnd Janak, whose imperial sway\\nThe men of MÃ\\xadthilÃ¡(87) obey.\\nThe firm of vow, the dread of foes,\\nWho all the lore of Scripture knows,\\nInvite him here with honour high,\\nKing DaÅ\\x9barathaâ\\x80\\x99s old ally.\\nAnd KÃ¡Å\\x9biâ\\x80\\x99s(88) lord of gentle speech,\\nWho finds a pleasant word for each,\\nIn length of days our monarchâ\\x80\\x99s peer,\\nIllustrious king, invite him here.\\nThe father of our rulerâ\\x80\\x99s bride,\\nKnown for his virtues far and wide,\\nThe king whom Kekayaâ\\x80\\x99s(89) realms obey,\\nHim with his son invite, I pray.\\nAnd LomapÃ¡d the Angasâ\\x80\\x99 king,\\nTrue to his vows and godlike, bring.\\nFor be thine invitations sent\\nTo west and south and orient.\\nCall those who rule SurÃ¡shá¹\\xadraâ\\x80\\x99s(90) land,\\nSuvÃ\\xadraâ\\x80\\x99s(91) realm and Sindhuâ\\x80\\x99s strand,\\nAnd all the kings of earth beside\\nIn friendshipâ\\x80\\x99s bonds with us allied:\\nInvite them all to hasten in\\nWith retinue and kith and kin.â\\x80\\x9d\\n  VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadhaâ\\x80\\x99s speech without delay\\nSumantra bent him to obey.\\nAnd sent his trusty envoys forth\\nEastward and westward, south and north.\\nObedient to the saintâ\\x80\\x99s request\\nHimself he hurried forth, and pressed\\nEach nobler chief and lord and king\\nTo hasten to the gathering.\\nBefore the saint VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha stood\\nAll those who wrought with stone and wood,\\nAnd showed the work which every one\\nIn furtherance of the rite had done,\\nRejoiced their ready zeal to see,\\nThus to the craftsmen all said he:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI charge ye, masters, see to this,\\nThat there be nothing done amiss,\\nAnd this, I pray, in mind be borne,\\nThat not one gift ye give in scorn:\\nWhenever scorn a gift attends\\nGreat sin is his who thus offends.â\\x80\\x9d\\n  And now some days and nights had past,\\nAnd kings began to gather fast,\\nAnd precious gems in liberal store\\nAs gifts to DaÅ\\x9baratha bore.\\nThen joy thrilled through VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadhaâ\\x80\\x99s breast\\nAs thus the monarch he addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cObedient to thy high decree\\nThe kings, my lord, are come to thee.\\nAnd it has been my care to greet\\nAnd honour all with reverence meet.\\nThy servantsâ\\x80\\x99 task is ended quite,\\nAnd all is ready for the rite.\\nCome forth then to the sacred ground\\nWhere all in order will be found.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen RishyaÅ\\x9bring confirmed the tale:\\nNor did their words to move him fail.\\nThe stars propitious influence lent\\nWhen forth the worldâ\\x80\\x99s great ruler went.\\n  Then by the sage VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha led\\n    The priest begun to speed\\n  Those glorious rites wherein is shed\\n    The lifeblood of the steed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XIII.

spirit pure from earthly taint,\\nWith one accord had sought the place\\nThe high-souled monarchâ\\x80\\x99s rite to grace.\\nThen to the Gods who came to take\\nTheir proper share the hermit spake:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor you has DaÅ\\x9baratha slain\\nThe votive steed, a son to gain;\\nStern penance-rites the king has tried,\\nAnd in firm faith on you relied,\\nAnd now with undiminished care\\nA second rite would fain prepare.\\nBut, O ye Gods, consent to grant\\nThe longing of your supplicant.\\nFor him beseeching hands I lift,\\nAnd pray you all to grant the gift,\\nThat four fair

degree\\nWe love the king and honour thee.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  These words the Gods in answer said,\\nAnd vanished thence by Indra led.\\nThus to the Lord, the worlds who made,\\nThe Immortals all assembled prayed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO BrahmÃ¡, mighty by thy grace,\\nRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87, who rules the giant race,\\nTorments us in his senseless pride,\\nAnd penance-loving saints beside.\\nFor thou well pleased in days of old\\nGavest the boon that makes him bold,\\nThat God nor demon eâ\\x80\\x99er should kill\\nHis charmed life, for so thy will.\\nWe, honouring that high behest,\\nBear all his rage though sore distressed.\\nThat lord of giants fierce and fell\\nScourges the earth and heaven and hell.\\nMad with thy boon, his impious rage\\nSmites saint and bard and God and sage.\\nThe sun himself withholds his glow,\\nThe wind in fear forbears to blow;\\nThe fire restrains his wonted heat\\nWhere stand the dreaded RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s feet,\\nAnd, necklaced with the wandering wave,\\nThe sea before him fears to rave.\\nKuveraâ\\x80\\x99s self in sad defeat\\nIs driven from his blissful seat.\\nWe see, we feel the giantâ\\x80\\x99s might,\\nAnd woe comes oâ\\x80\\x99er us and affright.\\nTo thee, O Lord, thy suppliants pray\\nTo find some cure this plague to stay.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus by the gathered Gods addressed\\nHe pondered in his secret breast,\\nAnd said: â\\x80\\x9cOne only way I find\\nTo slay this fiend of evil mind.\\nHe prayed me once his life to guard\\nFrom demon, God, and heavenly bard,\\nAnd spirits of the earth and air,\\nAnd I consenting heard his prayer.\\nBut the proud giant in his scorn\\nRecked not of man of woman born.\\nNone else may take his life away,\\nBut only man the fiend may slay.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThe Gods, with Indra at their head,\\nRejoiced to hear the words he said.\\nThen crowned with glory like a flame,\\nLord Vishá¹\\x87u to the council came;\\nHis hands shell, mace, and discus bore,\\nAnd saffron were the robes he wore.\\nRiding his eagle through the crowd,\\nAs the sun rides upon a cloud,\\nWith bracelets of fine gold, he came\\nLoud welcomed by the Godsâ\\x80\\x99 acclaim.\\nHis praise they sang with one consent,\\nAnd cried, in lowly reverence bent:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO Lord whose hand fierce Madhu(106) slew,\\nBe thou our refuge, firm and true;\\nFriend of the suffering worlds art thou,\\nWe pray thee help thy suppliants now.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen Vishá¹\\x87u spake: â\\x80\\x9cYe Gods, declare,\\nWhat may I do to grant your prayer?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cKing DaÅ\\x9baratha,â\\x80\\x9d thus cried they,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFervent in penance many a day,\\nThe sacrificial steed has slain,\\nLonging for sons, but all in vain.\\nNow, at the cry of us forlorn,\\nIncarnate as his seed be born.\\nThree queens has he: each lovely dame\\nLike Beauty, Modesty, or Fame.\\nDivide thyself in four, and be\\nHis offspring by these noble three.\\nManâ\\x80\\x99s nature take, and slay in fight\\nRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 who laughs at heavenly might:\\nThis common scourge, this rankling thorn\\nWhom the three worlds too long have borne\\nFor RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 in the senseless pride\\nOf might unequalled has defied\\nThe host of heaven, and plagues with woe\\nAngel and bard and saint below,\\nCrushing each spirit and each maid\\nWho plays in Nandanâ\\x80\\x99s(107) heavenly shade.\\nO conquering Lord, to thee we bow;\\nOur surest hope and trust art thou.\\nRegard the world of men below,\\nAnd slay the Godsâ\\x80\\x99 tremendous foe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  When thus the suppliant Gods had prayed,\\nHis wise reply NÃ¡rÃ¡yaá¹\\x87(108) made:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat task demands my presence there,\\nAnd whence this dread, ye Gods declare.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The Gods replied: â\\x80\\x9cWe fear, O Lord,\\nFierce RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87, ravener abhorred.\\nBe thine the glorious task, we pray,\\nIn human form this fiend to slay.\\nBy thee of all the Blest alone\\nThis sinner may be overthrown.\\nHe gained by penance long and dire\\nThe favour of the mighty Sire.\\nThen He who every gift bestows\\nGuarded the fiend from heavenly foes,\\nAnd gave a pledge his life that kept\\nFrom all things living, man except.\\nOn him thus armed no other foe\\nThan man may deal the deadly blow.\\nAssume, O King, a mortal birth,\\nAnd strike the demon to the earth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then Vishá¹\\x87u, God of Gods, the Lord\\nSupreme by all the worlds adored,\\nTo BrahmÃ¡ and the suppliants spake:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDismiss your fear: for your dear sake\\nIn battle will I smite him dead,\\nThe cruel fiend, the Immortalâ\\x80\\x99s dread.\\nAnd lords and ministers and all\\nHis kith and kin with him shall fall.\\nThen, in the world of mortal men,\\nTen thousand years and hundreds ten\\nI as a human king will reign,\\nAnd guard the earth as my domain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  God, saint, and nymph, and minstrel throng\\nWith heavenly voices raised their song\\nIn hymns of triumph to the God\\nWhose conquering feet on Madhu trod:\\n  â\\x80\\x9cChampion of Gods, as man appear,\\n    This cruel RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 slay,\\n  The thorn that saints and hermits fear,\\n    The plague that none can stay.\\n  In savage fury uncontrolled\\n    His pride for ever grows:\\n  He dares the Lord of Gods to hold\\n    Among his deadly foes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XV. The Nectar.\\n\\n\\nWhen wisest Vishá¹\\x87u thus had given\\nHis promise to the Gods of heaven,\\nHe pondered in his secret mind\\nA suited place of birth to find,\\nThen he decreed, the lotus-eyed,\\nIn four his being to divide,\\nAnd DaÅ\\x9baratha, gracious king,\\nHe chose as sire from whom to spring.\\nThat childless prince of high renown,\\nWho smote in war his foemen down,\\nAt that same time with utmost care\\nPrepared the rite that wins an heir.(109)\\nThen Vishá¹\\x87u, fain on earth to dwell,\\nBade the Almighty Sire farewell,\\nAnd vanished while a reverent crowd\\nOf Gods and saints in worship bowed.\\n\\n  The monarch watched the sacred rite,\\nWhen a vast form of awful might,\\nOf matchless splendour, strength, and size\\nWas manifest before his eyes.\\nFrom forth the sacrificial flame,\\nDark, robed in red, the being came.\\nHis voice was drumlike, loud and low,\\nHis face suffused with rosy glow.\\nLike a huge lionâ\\x80\\x99s mane appeared\\nThe long locks of his hair and beard.\\nHe shone with many a lucky sign,\\nAnd many an ornament divine;\\nA towering mountain in his height,\\nA tiger in his gait and might.\\nNo precious mine more rich could be,\\nNo burning flame more bright than he.\\nHis arms embraced in loving hold,\\nLike a dear wife, a vase of gold\\nWhose silver lining held a draught\\nOf nectar as in heaven is quaffed:\\nA vase so vast, so bright to view,\\nThey scarce could count the vision true.\\nUpon the king his eyes he bent,\\nAnd said: â\\x80\\x9cThe Lord of life has sent\\nHis servant down, O Prince, to be\\nA messenger from heaven to thee.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThe king with all his nobles by\\nRaised reverent hands and made reply:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWelcome, O glorious being! Say\\nHow can my care thy grace repay.â\\x80\\x9d\\nEnvoy of Him whom all adore\\nThus to the king he spake once more:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Gods accept thy worship: they\\nGive thee the blessed fruit to-day.\\nApproach and take, O glorious King,\\nThis heavenly nectar which I bring,\\nFor it shall give thee sons and wealth,\\nAnd bless thee with a store of health.\\nGive it to those fair queens of thine,\\nAnd bid them quaff the drink divine:\\nAnd they the princely sons shall bear\\nLong sought by sacrifice and prayer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cYea, O my lord,â\\x80\\x9d the monarch said,\\nAnd took the vase upon his head,\\nThe gift of Gods, of fine gold wrought,\\nWith store of heavenly liquor fraught.\\nHe honoured, filled with transport new,\\nThat wondrous being, fair to view,\\nAs round the envoy of the God\\nWith reverential steps he trod.(110)\\nHis errand done, that form of light\\nArose and vanished from the sight.\\nHigh rapture filled the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s soul,\\nPossessed of that celestial bowl,\\nAs when a man by want distressed\\nWith unexpected wealth is blest.\\nAnd rays of transport seemed to fall\\nIlluminating bower and hall,\\nAs when the autumn moon rides high,\\nAnd floods with lovely light the sky.\\nQuick to the ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 bower he sped,\\nAnd thus to Queen KauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡ said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis genial nectar take and quaff,â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe spoke, and gave the lady half.\\nPart of the nectar that remained\\nSumitrÃ¡ from his hand obtained.\\nHe gave, to make her fruitful too,\\nKaikeyÃ\\xad half the residue.\\nA portion yet remaining there,\\n  He paused awhile to think.\\nThen gave SumitrÃ¡, with her share.\\n  The remnant of the drink.\\nThus on each queen of those fair three\\n  A part the king bestowed,\\nAnd with sweet hope a child to see\\n  Their yearning bosoms glowed.\\nThe heavenly bowl the king supplied\\n  Their longing souls relieved,\\nAnd soon, with rapture and with pride,\\n  Each royal dame conceived.\\nHe gazed upon each ladyâ\\x80\\x99s face,\\n  And triumphed as he gazed,\\nAs Indra in his royal place\\n  By Gods and spirits praised.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XVI.

Then UmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s lord,(198)\\nKing of creation, world adored,\\nThus spoke to great BhagÃ\\xadrath: â\\x80\\x9cI,\\nWell pleased thy wish will gratify,\\nAnd on my head her waves shall fling\\nThe daughter of the Mountainsâ\\x80\\x99 King!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe stood upon the lofty crest\\n  That crowns the Lord of Snow,\\nAnd bade the river of the Blest\\n  Descend on earth below.\\nHimÃ¡layaâ\\x80\\x99s child, adored of all,\\n  The haughty mandate heard,\\nAnd her proud bosom, at the call,\\n  With furious wrath was stirred.\\nDown from her channel in the skies\\n  With awful might she sped\\nWith a giantâ\\x80\\x99s rush, in a giantâ\\x80\\x99s size,\\n  On Å\\x9aivaâ\\x80\\x99s holy head.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe calls me,â\\x80\\x9d in her wrath she cried,\\n  â\\x80\\x9cAnd all my flood shall sweep\\nAnd whirl him in its whelming tide\\n  To hellâ\\x80\\x99s profoundest deep.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe held the river on his head,\\n  And kept her wandering,

tamed,\\n  Amid his locks to rove.\\nThere, many lengthening seasons through,\\n  The wildered river ran:\\nBhagÃ\\xadrath saw it, and anew\\n  His penance dire began.\\nThen Å\\x9aiva, for the

came;\\nHlÃ¡dinÃ\\xad, PÃ¡vanÃ\\xad, and she\\n  Called NalinÃ\\xad by name:\\nThese rolled their lucid waves along\\n  And sought the eastern side.\\nSuchakshu, SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ fair and strong,\\n  And Sindhuâ\\x80\\x99s mighty tideâ\\x80\\x94(199)\\nThese to the region of the west\\n  With joyful waters sped:\\nThe seventh, the brightest and the best,\\n  Flowed where BhagÃ\\xadrath led.\\nOn Å\\x9aivaâ\\x80\\x99s head descending first\\n  A rest the torrents found:\\nThen down in all their might they burst\\n  And roared along the ground.\\nOn countless glittering scales the beam\\n  Of rosy morning flashed,\\nWhere fish and dolphins through the stream\\n  Fallen and falling dashed.\\nThen bards who chant celestial lays\\n  And nymphs of heavenly birth\\nFlocked round upon that flood to gaze\\n  That streamed from sky to earth.\\nThe Gods themselves from every sphere,\\n  Incomparably bright,\\nBorne in their golden cars drew near\\n  To see the wondrous sight.\\nThe cloudless sky was all aflame\\n  With the light of a hundred suns\\nWhereâ\\x80\\x99er the shining chariots came\\n  That bore those holy ones.\\nSo flashed the air with crested snakes\\n  And fish of every hue\\nAs when the lightningâ\\x80\\x99s glory breaks\\n  Through fields of summer blue.\\nAnd white foam-clouds and silver spray\\n  Were wildly tossed on high,\\nLike swans that urge their homeward way\\n  Across the autumn sky.\\nNow ran the river calm and clear\\n  With current strong and deep:\\nNow slowly broadened to a mere,\\n  Or scarcely seemed to creep.\\nNow oâ\\x80\\x99er a length of sandy plain\\n  Her tranquil course she held;\\nNow rose her waves and sank again,\\n  By refluent waves repelled.\\nSo falling first on Å\\x9aivaâ\\x80\\x99s head,\\nThence rushing to their earthly bed,\\nIn ceaseless fall the waters streamed,\\nAnd pure with holy lustre gleamed.\\nThen every spirit, sage, and bard,\\nCondemned to earth by sentence hard,\\nPressed eagerly around the tide\\nThat Å\\x9aivaâ\\x80\\x99s touch had sanctified.\\nThen they whom heavenly doom had hurled,\\nAccursed, to this lower world,\\nTouched the pure wave, and freed from sin\\nResought the skies and entered in.\\nAnd all the world was glad, whereon\\nThe glorious water flowed and shone,\\nFor sin and stain were banished thence\\nBy the sweet riverâ\\x80\\x99s influence.\\nFirst, in a car of heavenly frame,\\nThe royal saint of deathless name,\\nBhagÃ\\xadrath, very glorious rode,\\nAnd after him fair GangÃ¡ flowed.\\nGod, sage, and bard, the chief in place\\nOf spirits and the NÃ¡ga race,\\nNymph, giant, fiend, in long array\\nSped where BhagÃ\\xadrath led the way;\\nAnd all the hosts the flood that swim\\nFollowed the stream that followed him.\\nWhereâ\\x80\\x99er the great BhagÃ\\xadrath led,\\nThere ever glorious GangÃ¡ fled,\\nThe best of floods, the riversâ\\x80\\x99 queen,\\nWhose waters wash the wicked clean.\\n\\n  It chanced that Jahnu, great and good,\\nEngaged with holy offerings stood;\\nThe river spread her waves around\\nFlooding his sacrificial ground.\\nThe saint in anger marked her pride,\\nAnd at one draught her stream he dried.\\nThen God, and sage, and bard, afraid,\\nTo noble high-souled Jahnu prayed,\\nAnd begged that he would kindly deem\\nHis own dear child that holy stream.\\nMoved by their suit, he soothed their fears\\nAnd loosed her waters from his ears.\\nHence GangÃ¡ through the world is styled\\nBoth JÃ¡hnavi and Jahnuâ\\x80\\x99s child.\\nThen onward still she followed fast,\\nAnd reached the great sea bank at last.\\nThence deep below her way she made\\nTo end those rites so long delayed.\\nThe monarch reached the Oceanâ\\x80\\x99s side,\\nAnd still behind him GangÃ¡ hied.\\nHe sought the depths which open lay\\nWhere Sagarâ\\x80\\x99s sons had dug their way.\\nSo leading through earthâ\\x80\\x99s nether caves\\nThe riverâ\\x80\\x99s purifying waves,\\nOver his kinsmenâ\\x80\\x99s dust the lord\\nHis funeral libation poured.\\nSoon as the flood their dust bedewed,\\nTheir spirits gained beatitude,\\nAnd all in heavenly bodies dressed\\nRose to the skiesâ\\x80\\x99 eternal rest.\\n\\n  Then thus to King BhagÃ\\xadrath said\\nBrahmÃ¡, when, coming at the head\\nOf all his bright celestial train,\\nHe saw those spirits freed from stain:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell done! great Prince of men, well done!\\nThy kinsmen bliss and heaven have won.\\nThe sons of Sagar mighty-souled,\\nAre with the Blest, as Gods, enrolled,\\nLong as the Oceanâ\\x80\\x99s flood shall stand\\nUpon the border of the land,\\nSo long shall Sagarâ\\x80\\x99s sons remain,\\nAnd, godlike, rank in heaven retain.\\nGangÃ¡ thine eldest child shall be,\\nCalled from thy name BhÃ¡girathÃ\\xad;\\nNamed alsoâ\\x80\\x94for her waters fell\\nFrom heaven and flow through earth and hellâ\\x80\\x94\\nTripathagÃ¡, stream of the skies,\\nBecause three paths she glorifies.\\nAnd, mighty King, â\\x80\\x99tis given thee now\\nTo free thee and perform thy vow.\\nNo longer, happy Prince, delay\\nDrink-offerings to thy kin to pay.\\nFor this the holiest Sagar sighed,\\nBut mourned the boon he sought denied.\\nThen AnÅ\\x9bumÃ¡n, dear Prince! although\\nNo brighter name the world could show,\\nStrove long the heavenly flood to gain\\nTo visit earth, but strove in vain.\\nNor was she by the sagesâ\\x80\\x99 peer,\\nBlest with all virtues, most austere,\\nThy sire DilÃ\\xadpa, hither brought,\\nThough with fierce prayers the boon he sought.\\nBut thou, O King, earned success,\\nAnd won high fame which God will bless.\\nThrough thee, O victor of thy foes,\\nOn earth this heavenly GangÃ¡ flows,\\nAnd thou hast gained the meed divine\\nThat waits on virtue such as thine.\\nNow in her ever holy wave\\nThyself, O best of heroes, lave:\\nSo shalt thou, pure from every sin,\\nThe blessed fruit of merit win.\\nNow for thy kin who died of yore\\nThe meet libations duly pour.\\nAbove the heavens I now ascend:\\nDepart, and bliss thy steps attend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus to the mighty king who broke\\nHis foemensâ\\x80\\x99 might, Lord BrahmÃ¡ spoke,\\nAnd with his Gods around him rose\\nTo his own heaven of blest repose.\\nThe royal sage no more delayed,\\nBut, the libation duly paid,\\nHome to his regal city hied\\nWith water cleansed and purified.\\nThere ruled he his ancestral state,\\nBest of all men, most fortunate.\\nAnd all the people joyed again\\nIn good BhagÃ\\xadrathâ\\x80\\x99s gentle reign.\\nRich, prosperous, and blest were they,\\nAnd grief and sickness fled away.\\nThus, RÃ¡ma, I at length have told\\nHow GangÃ¡ came from heaven of old.\\nNow, for the evening passes swift,\\nI wish thee each auspicious gift.\\nThis story of the floodâ\\x80\\x99s descent\\nWill giveâ\\x80\\x94for

form.\\nBut then each Titan, God, and saint,\\nConfused with terror, sick and faint,\\nTo high souled ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra hied,\\nAnd with soft words to soothe him tried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLord of high

day,\\nAround the royal shrine array,\\nWhere burns the fireâ\\x80\\x99s undying ray.\\nEach palace door, each city gate\\nWith wreaths of sandal decorate.\\nAnd with the garlandsâ\\x80\\x99 fragrant scent\\nLet clouds of incense-smoke be blent.\\nLet food of noble kind and taste\\nBe for a hundred thousand placed;\\nFresh curds with streams of milk bedewed\\nTo feed the BrÃ¡hman multitude.\\nWith

Thus gave command the twice-born pair\\nTo active servants stationed there.\\nThen hastened to the king and said\\nThat all their task was duly sped,\\nThe king to wise Sumantra spake:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow quick, my lord, thy chariot take,\\nAnd hither with thy swiftest speed\\nMy son, my noble RÃ¡ma lead.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Sumantra, ere the word was given,\\nHis chariot from the

those who dwell\\nIn the wild wood and on the fell,\\nAnd as the Gods to Indra, they\\nShowed honour to the king that day.\\n\\n  Like VÃ¡sav, when his glorious form\\nIs circled by the Gods of storm,\\nGirt in his hall by kings he saw\\nHis car-borne RÃ¡ma near him draw,\\nLike him who rules the minstrel band\\nOf heaven;(262) whose valour filled the land,\\nOf mighty arm and stately pride\\nLike a wild elephant in stride,\\nAs fair in face as that fair stone\\nDear to the moon, of moonbeams grown,(263)\\nWith noble gifts and grace that took\\nThe hearts of all, and chained each look,\\nWorld-cheering as the Lord of Rain\\nWhen floods relieve the parching plain.\\nThe father, as the son came nigh,\\nGazed with an ever-thirstier eye.\\nSumantra helped the prince alight\\nFrom the good chariot passing bright,\\nAnd as to meet his sire he went\\nFollowed behind him reverent.\\nThen RÃ¡ma clomb, the king to seek\\nThat terrace like KailÃ¡saâ\\x80\\x99s peak,\\nAnd reached the presence of the king,\\nSumantra closely following.\\nBefore his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s face he came,\\nRaised suppliant hands and named his name,(264)\\nAnd bowing lowly as is meet\\nPaid reverence to the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s feet.\\nBut soon as DaÅ\\x9baratha viewed\\nThe prince in humble attitude,\\nHe raised him by the hand in haste\\nAnd his beloved son embraced,\\nThen signed him to a glorious throne,\\nGem-decked and golden, near his own.\\nThen RÃ¡ma, best of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s line,\\nMade the fair seat with lustre shine\\nAs when the orient sun upsprings\\nAnd his pure beam on Meru flings.\\nThe glory flashed on roof and wall,\\nAnd with strange sheen suffused the hall,\\nAs when the moonâ\\x80\\x99s pure rays are sent\\nThrough autumnâ\\x80\\x99s star-lit firmament.\\nThen swelled his breast with joy and pride\\nAs his dear son the father eyed,\\nEâ\\x80\\x99en as himself more fair arrayed\\nIn some clear mirrorâ\\x80\\x99s face displayed.\\nThe aged monarch gazed awhile,\\nThen thus addressed him with a smile,\\nAs KaÅ\\x9byap, whom the worlds revere,\\nSpeaks for the Lord of Gods to hear:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO thou of all my sons most dear,\\nIn virtue best, thy fatherâ\\x80\\x99s peer,\\nChild of my consort first in place,\\nMine equal in her pride of race,\\nBecause the peopleâ\\x80\\x99s hearts are bound\\nTo thee by graces in thee found,\\nBe thou in Pushyaâ\\x80\\x99s favouring hour\\nMade partner of my royal power.\\nI know that thou by natureâ\\x80\\x99s bent\\nBoth modest art and excellent,\\nBut though thy gifts no counsel need\\nMy love suggests the friendly rede.\\nMine own dear son, be modest still,\\nAnd rule each sense with earnest will.\\nKeep thou the evils far away\\nThat spring from love and angerâ\\x80\\x99s sway.\\nThy noble course alike pursue\\nIn secret as in open view,\\nAnd every nerve, the love to gain\\nOf ministers and subjects, strain.\\nThe happy prince who sees with pride\\nHis thriving people satisfied;\\nWhose arsenals with arms are stored,\\nAnd treasury with golden hoard,â\\x80\\x94\\nHis friends rejoice as joyed the Blest\\nWhen Amrit crowned their eager quest.\\nSo well, my child, thy course maintain,\\nAnd from all ill thy soul refrain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The friends of RÃ¡ma, gathered nigh,\\nLonging their lord to gratify,\\nRan to KauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s bower to tell\\nThe tidings that would please her well.\\nShe, host of dames, with many a gem,\\nAnd gold, and kine rewarded them.\\n\\n  Then RÃ¡ma paid the reverence due,\\nMounted the chariot, and withdrew,\\nAnd to his splendid dwelling drove\\nWhile crowds to show him honour strove.\\n  The people, when the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s speech\\n    Their willing ears had heard,\\n  Were wild with joy as though on each\\n    Great gifts had been conferred.\\n  With meek and low salute each man\\n    Turned to his home away,\\n  And there with happy heart began\\n    To all the Gods to pray.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto

plan.\\nMisguided by the hump-backâ\\x80\\x99s guile\\nShe pondered her resolve awhile,\\nAs the fair path that bliss secured\\nThe miserable lady lured,\\nDevoted to her queen, and swayed\\nBy hopes of gain and bliss, the maid\\nRejoiced, her ladyâ\\x80\\x99s purpose known,\\nAnd deemed the prize she sought her own.\\nThen bent upon her purpose dire,\\nKaikeyÃ\\xad with her soul on fire,\\nUpon the floor lay, languid, down,\\nHer brows contracted in a frown.\\nThe bright-hued wreath that bound her hair,\\nChains, necklets, jewels rich and rare,\\nStripped off by her own fingers lay\\nSpread on the ground in disarray,\\nAnd to the floor a lustre lent\\nAs stars light up the firmament.\\nThus prostrate in the mournerâ\\x80\\x99s cell,\\nIn garb of woe the lady fell,\\nHer long hair in a single braid,\\nLike some fair nymph of heaven dismayed.(272)\\n\\n  The monarch, RÃ¡ma to install,\\nWith thoughtful care had ordered all,\\nAnd now within his home withdrew,\\nDismissing first his

king of men\\nEntered the empty room till then.\\nStill urged by love and anxious thought\\nNews of his favourite queen he sought,\\nFor never had his loving eyes\\nFound her or selfish or unwise.\\nThen spoke at length the warder maid,\\nWith hands upraised and sore afraid:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy Lord and King, the queen has sought\\nThe mournerâ\\x80\\x99s cell with rage

sin,\\nLow on the ground, his own sweet wife,\\nTo him far dearer than his life,\\nLike some fair creeping plant uptorn,\\nOr like a maid of heaven forlorn,\\nA nymph of air or Goddess sent\\nFrom Swarga down in banishment.\\n\\n  As some wild elephant who tries\\nTo soothe his consort as she lies\\nStruck by the hunterâ\\x80\\x99s venomed dart,\\nSo the great king disturbed in heart,\\nStrove

woe,\\nAs if some goblin of the night\\nHad struck thee with a deadly blight,\\nAnd cast foul influence on her\\nWhose spells my loving bosom stir?\\nI have Physicians famed for skill,\\nEach trained to cure some special ill:\\nMy sweetest lady, tell thy pain,\\nAnd they shall make thee well again.\\nWhom, darling, wouldst thou punished see?\\nOr whom enriched with lordly fee?\\nWeep not, my lovely Queen, and stay\\nThis grief that wears thy frame away;\\nSpeak, and the guilty shall be freed.\\nThe guiltless be condemned to bleed,\\nThe poor enriched, the rich abased,\\nThe low set high,

wrought.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes some wild dream my heart assail?\\nOr do my troubled senses fail?\\nDoes some dire portent scare my view?\\nOr frenzyâ\\x80\\x99s stroke my soul subdue?â\\x80\\x9d\\nThus as he thought, his troubled mind\\nIn doubt and dread no rest could find,\\nDistressed and trembling like a deer\\nWho sees the dreaded tigress near.\\nOn the bare ground his limbs he threw,\\nAnd many a long deep sigh he drew,\\nLike a wild snake, with fury blind,\\nBy charms within a ring confined.\\nOnce as the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s fury woke,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShame on thee!â\\x80\\x9d from his bosom broke,\\nAnd then in sense-bewildering pain\\nHe fainted on the ground again.\\nAt length, when slowly strength returned,\\nHe answered as his eyeballs burned\\nWith the wild fury of his

forsake?\\nNo, take my life, my glory take:\\nLet either queen be from me torn,\\nBut not my well-loved eldest-born.\\nHim but to see is highest bliss,\\nAnd death itself his face to miss.\\nThe world may sunless stand, the grain\\nMay thrive without the genial rain,\\nBut if my RÃ¡ma be not nigh\\nMy spirit from its frame will fly.\\nEnough, thine impious plan forgo,\\nO thou who plottest sin and woe.\\nMy head before thy feet, I kneel,\\nAnd pray thee some compassion feel.\\nO wicked dame, what can have led\\nThy heart to dare a plot so dread?\\nPerchance thy purpose is to sound\\nThe grace thy son with me has found;\\nPerchance the words that, all these days,\\nThou still hast said in RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s praise,\\nWere only feigned, designed to cheer\\nWith flatteries a fatherâ\\x80\\x99s ear.\\nSoon as thy grief, my Queen, I knew,\\nMy bosom felt the anguish too.\\nIn empty halls art thou possessed,\\nAnd subject to anothersâ\\x80\\x99 hest?\\nNow on IkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s ancient

now,\\nNor said a word to make me grieve,\\nNow will I now thy sin believe.\\nWith thee my RÃ¡ma used to hold\\nLike place with Bharat lofty-souled.\\nAs thou so often, when the pair\\nWere children yet, wouldst fain declare.\\nAnd can thy righteous soul endure\\nThat RÃ¡ma glorious, pious, pure,\\nShould to the distant wilds be sent\\nFor fourteen years of banishment?\\nYea, RÃ¡ma Bharatâ\\x80\\x99s self exceeds\\nIn love to thee and sonlike deeds,\\nAnd, for deserving love of thee,\\nAs Bharat, even so is he.\\nWho better than that chieftain may\\nObedience, love, and honour pay,\\nThy dignity with care protect,\\nThy slightest word and wish respect?\\nOf all his countless followers none\\nCan breathe a word against my son;\\nOf many thousands not a dame\\nCan hint

hand to give, the heart to feel,\\nThe love that neâ\\x80\\x99er betrays a friend,\\nThe rectitude that naught can bend,\\nKnowledge, and meek obedience grace\\nMy RÃ¡ma pride of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s race.\\nCanst thou thine impious plot design\\nâ\\x80\\x99Gainst him in whom these virtues shine,\\nWhose glory with the sages vies,\\nPeer of the Gods who rule the skies!\\nFrom him no harsh or bitter word\\nTo pain one creature have I heard,\\nAnd how can I my son address,\\nFor thee, with words of bitterness?\\nHave mercy, Queen: some pity show\\nTo see my tears of anguish flow,\\nAnd listen to my mournful cry,\\nA poor old man who soon must die.\\nWhateâ\\x80\\x99er this sea-girt land can boast\\nOf rich and rare from coast to coast,\\nTo thee, my Queen, I give it all:\\nBut O, thy deadly words recall:\\nO see, my suppliant hands entreat,\\nAgain my lips are on thy feet:\\nSave RÃ¡ma, save my darling child,\\nNor kill me with this sin defiled.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe grovelled on the ground, and lay\\nTo burning grief a senseless prey,\\nAnd ever and anon, assailed\\nBy floods of woe he wept and wailed,\\nStriving with eager speed to gain\\nThe margent of his sea of pain.\\n\\n  With fiercer words she fiercer yet\\nThe hapless fatherâ\\x80\\x99s pleading met:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO Monarch, if thy soul repent\\nThe promise and thy free consent,\\nHow wilt thou in the

the royal fans, to grace\\nThe lotus beauty of thy face,\\nFair as the moon or wild-swanâ\\x80\\x99s wing,\\nAnd waving round the new-made king?\\nWhy do no sweet-toned bards rejoice\\nTo hail thee with triumphant voice?\\nNo tuneful heralds love to raise\\nLoud music in their monarchâ\\x80\\x99s praise?\\nWhy do no BrÃ¡hmans, Scripture-read,\\nPour curds and honey on thy head,\\nAnointed, as the laws ordain,\\nWith holy rites, supreme to reign?\\nWhere are the chiefs of every guild?\\nWhere are the myriads should have filled\\nThe streets, and followed home their king\\nWith merry noise and triumphing?\\nWhy does no gold-wrought chariot lead\\nWith four brave horses, best for speed?\\nNo elephant precede the crowd\\nLike a huge hill or thunder cloud,\\nMarked from his birth for happy fate,\\nWhom signs auspicious decorate?\\nWhy does no henchman, young and fair,\\nPrecede thee, and delight to bear\\nEntrusted to his reverent hold\\nThe burthen of thy throne of gold?\\nWhy, if the

first the shades of night descend\\nSince to the wilds our steps we bend.\\nJoy to thee, brother! do not grieve\\nFor our dear home and all we leave.\\nThe woods unpeopled seem to weep\\nAround us, as their tenants creep\\nOr fly to lair and den and nest,\\nBoth bird and beast, to seek their rest.\\nMethinks AyodhyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s royal town\\nWhere dwells my sire of high renown,\\nWith all her men and dames to-night\\nWill mourn us vanished from their sight.\\nFor, by his virtues won, they cling\\nIn fond affection to their king,\\nAnd thee and me, O brave and true,\\nAnd Bharat and Å\\x9aatrughna too.\\nI for my sire and mother feel\\nDeep sorrow oâ\\x80\\x99er my bosom steal,\\nLest mourning us, oppressed with fears,\\nThey blind their eyes with endless tears.\\nYet Bharatâ\\x80\\x99s duteous love will show\\nSweet comfort in their hours of woe,\\nAnd with kind words their hearts sustain,\\nSuggesting duty, bliss, and gain.\\nI mourn my parents now no more:\\nI count dear Bharatâ\\x80\\x99s virtues oâ\\x80\\x99er,\\nAnd his kind love and care dispel\\nThe doubts I had, and all is well.\\nAnd thou thy duty wouldst not shun,\\nAnd, following me, hast nobly done;\\nElse, bravest, I should need a band\\nAround my wife as guard to stand.\\nOn this first night, my thirst to slake,\\nSome water only will I take:\\nThus, brother, thus my will decides,\\nThough varied store the wood provides.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus having said to Lakshmaá¹\\x87, he\\nAddressed in turn Sumantra: â\\x80\\x9cBe\\nMost diligent to-night, my friend,\\nAnd with due care thy horses tend.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThe sun had set: Sumantra tied\\nHis noble horses side by side,\\nGave store of grass with liberal hand,\\nAnd rested near them on the strand.\\nEach paid the holy evening rite,\\nAnd when around them fell the night,\\nThe charioteer, with Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s aid,\\nA lowly bed for RÃ¡ma laid.\\nTo Lakshmaá¹\\x87 RÃ¡ma bade adieu,\\nAnd then by SÃ\\xadtÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s side he threw\\nHis limbs upon the leafy bed\\nTheir care upon the bank had spread.\\nWhen Lakshmaá¹\\x87 saw the couple slept,\\nStill on the strand his watch he kept,\\nStill with Sumantra there conversed,\\nAnd RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s varied gifts rehearsed.\\nAll night he watched, nor sought repose,\\nTill on the earth the sun arose:\\nWith him Sumantra stayed awake,\\nAnd still of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s virtues spake.\\nThus, near the riverâ\\x80\\x99s grassy shore\\nWhich herds unnumbered wandered oâ\\x80\\x99er,\\nRepose, untroubled, RÃ¡ma found,\\nAnd all the people lay around.\\nThe glorious hero left his bed,\\nLooked on the sleeping crowd, and said\\nTo Lakshmaá¹\\x87, whom each lucky line\\nMarked out for bliss with surest sign:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cO brother Lakshmaá¹\\x87, look on these\\nReclining at the roots of trees;\\nAll care of house and home resigned,\\nCaring for us with heart and mind,\\nThese people of the city yearn\\nTo see us to our home return:\\nTo quit their lives will they consent,\\nBut never leave their firm intent.\\nCome, while they all unconscious sleep,\\nLet us upon the chariot leap,\\nAnd swiftly on our journey speed\\nWhere naught our progress may impede,\\nThat these fond citizens who roam\\nFar from IkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s ancient home,\\nNo more may sleep â\\x80\\x99neath bush and tree,\\nFollowing still for love of me.\\nA prince with tender care should heal\\nThe self-brought woes his people feel,\\nAnd never let his subjects share\\nThe burthen he is forced to bear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then Lakshmaá¹\\x87 to the chief replied,\\nWho stood like Justice by his side:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThy rede, O sage, I well commend:\\nWithout delay the car ascend.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen RÃ¡ma to Sumantra spoke:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThy rapid steeds, I pray thee, yoke.\\nHence to the forest will I go:\\nAway, my lord, and be not slow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Sumantra, urged to utmost speed,\\nYoked to the car each generous steed,\\nAnd then, with hand to hand applied,\\nHe came before the chief and cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHail, Prince, whom mighty arms adorn,\\nHail, bravest of the chariot-borne!\\nWith SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ and thy brother thou\\nMayst mount: the car is ready now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The hero clomb the car with haste:\\nHis bow and gear within were placed,\\nAnd quick the eddying flood he passed\\nOf TamasÃ¡ whose waves run fast.\\nSoon as he touched the farther side,\\nThat strong-armed hero, glorified,\\nHe found a road both wide and clear,\\nWhere eâ\\x80\\x99en the timid naught could fear.\\nThen, that the crowd might be misled,\\nThus RÃ¡ma to Sumantra said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeed north a while, then hasten back,\\nReturning in thy former track,\\nThat so the people may not learn\\nThe course I follow: drive and turn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Sumantra, at the chiefâ\\x80\\x99s behest,\\nQuick to the task himself addressed;\\nThen near to RÃ¡ma came, and showed\\nThe chariot ready for the road.\\nWith SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, then, the princely two,\\nWho oâ\\x80\\x99er the line of Raghu threw\\nA glory ever bright and new,\\n  Upon the chariot stood.\\nSumantra fast and faster drove\\nHis horses, who in fleetness strove\\nStill onward to the distant grove,\\n  The hermit-haunted wood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XLVII. The Citizensâ\\x80\\x99 Return.\\n\\n\\nThe people, when the morn shone fair,\\nArose to find no RÃ¡ma there.\\nThen fear and numbing grief subdued\\nThe senses of the multitude.\\nThe woe-born tears were running fast\\nAs all around their eyes they cast,\\nAnd sadly looked, but found no trace\\nOf RÃ¡ma, searching every place.\\nBereft of RÃ¡ma good and wise,\\nWith drooping cheer and weeping eyes,\\nEach woe-distracted sage gave vent\\nTo sorrow in his wild lament:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWoe worth the sleep that stole our sense\\nWith its beguiling influence,\\nThat now we look in vain for him\\nOf the broad chest and stalwart limb!\\nHow could the strong-armed hero, thus\\nDeceiving all, abandon us?\\nHis people so devoted see,\\nYet to the woods, a hermit, flee?\\nHow can he, wont our hearts to cheer,\\nAs a fond sire his children dear,â\\x80\\x94\\nHow can the pride of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s race\\nFly from us to some desert place!\\nHere let us all for death prepare,\\nOr on the last great journey fare;(320)\\nOf RÃ¡ma our dear lord bereft,\\nWhat profit in our lives is left?\\nHuge trunks of trees around us lie,\\nWith roots and branches sere and dry,\\nCome let us set these logs on fire\\nAnd throw our bodies on the pyre.\\nWhat shall we speak?

Lakshmaá¹\\x87 toward him flew.\\nThen Guha, at the sight distressed,\\nHis arms around the hero pressed,\\nLaid both his hands upon his head\\nBowed to those lotus feet, and said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO RÃ¡ma, make thy wishes known,\\nAnd be this kingdom as thine own.\\nWho, mighty-armed, will ever see\\nA guest so dear as thou to me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He placed before him dainty fare\\nOf every

belong.\\nThy servants we, our lord art thou;\\nBegin, good king, thine empire now.\\nSee, various food before thee placed,\\nAnd cups to drink and sweets to taste\\nFor thee soft beds are hither borne,\\nAnd for thy horses grass and corn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  To Guha as he pressed and prayed,\\nThus Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son his answer made:\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Twas aye thy care my heart to please\\nWith honour, love, and courtesies,\\nAnd friendship brings thee now to greet\\nThy guest thus humbly on thy feet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Again the hero spake, as round\\nThe king his shapely arms he wound:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGuha, I see that all is well\\nWith thee and those who with thee dwell;\\nThat health and bliss and wealth attend\\nThy realm, thyself, and every friend.\\nBut all these friendly gifts of thine,\\nBound to refuse, I must decline.\\nGrass, bark, and hide my only wear,\\nAnd woodland roots and fruit my fare,\\nOn duty all my heart is set;\\nI seek the woods, an

here\\nAre to my sire supremely dear;\\nAnd kind attention paid to these\\nWill honour me and highly please.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then Guha quickly bade his train\\nGive water to the steeds, and grain.\\nAnd RÃ¡ma, ere the night grew dark,\\nPaid evening rites in dress of bark,\\nAnd tasted water, on the strand,\\nDrawn from the stream by Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s hand.\\nAnd Lakshmaá¹\\x87 with observance meet\\nBathed his beloved brotherâ\\x80\\x99s feet,\\nWho rested with his Maithil spouse:\\nThen sat him down â\\x80\\x99neath distant boughs.\\nAnd Guha with his bow sat near\\nTo Lakshmaá¹\\x87 and the charioteer,\\nAnd with the prince conversing kept\\nHis faithful watch while RÃ¡ma slept.\\nAs DaÅ\\x9barathaâ\\x80\\x99s glorious heir,\\nOf lofty soul and wisdom

Lakshmanâ\\x80\\x99s Lament.\\n\\n\\nAs Lakshmaá¹\\x87 still his vigil held\\nBy unaffected love impelled,\\nGuha, whose heart the sight distressed,\\nWith words like these the prince addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBeloved youth, this pleasant bed\\nWas brought for thee, for thee is spread;\\nOn this, my Prince, thine eyelids close,\\nAnd heal fatigue with sweet repose.\\nMy men are all to labour trained,\\nBut hardship thou hast neâ\\x80\\x99er sustained.\\nAll we this night our watch will keep\\nAnd guard Kakutsthaâ\\x80\\x99s son asleep.\\nIn all the world there breathes not one\\nMore dear to me than Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son.\\nThe words I speak, heroic youth,\\nAre true: I swear it by my truth.\\nThrough his dear grace supreme renown\\nWill, so I trust, my wishes crown.\\nSo shall my life rich store obtain\\nOf merit, blest with joy and gain.\\nWhile Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son and SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ lie\\nEntranced in happy slumber, I\\nWill, with my trusty bow in hand,\\nGuard my dear friend with all my band.\\nTo me, who oft these forests range,\\nIs naught therein or new or strange.\\nWe could with equal might oppose\\nA four-fold army led by foes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then royal Lakshmaá¹\\x87 made reply:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith thee to stand as guardian nigh,\\nWhose faithful soul regards the right,\\nFearless we well might rest to-night.\\nBut how, when RÃ¡ma lays his head\\nWith SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ on his lowly bed,â\\x80\\x94\\nHow can I sleep? how can I care\\nFor life, or aught thatâ\\x80\\x99s bright and fair?\\nBehold the conquering chief, whose might\\nIs match for Gods and fiends in fight;\\nWith SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ now he rests his head\\nAsleep on grass beneath him spread.\\nWon by devotion, text, and prayer,\\nAnd many a rite performed with care,\\nChief of our fatherâ\\x80\\x99s sons he shines\\nWell marked, like him, with favouring signs.\\nBrief, brief the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s life will be\\nNow his dear son is forced to flee;\\nAnd quickly will the widowed state\\nMourn for her lord disconsolate.\\nEach mourner there has wept her fill;\\nThe cries of anguish now are still:\\nIn the kingâ\\x80\\x99s hall each dame, oâ\\x80\\x99ercome\\nWith weariness of woe is dumb.\\nThis first sad night of grief, I ween,\\nWill do to death each sorrowing queen:\\nScarce is KauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡ left alive;\\nMy mother, too, can scarce survive.\\nIf when her heart is fain to break,\\nShe lingers for Å\\x9aatrughnaâ\\x80\\x99s sake,\\nKauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡, mother of the chief,\\nMust sink beneath the chilling grief.\\nThat town which countless thousands fill,\\nWhose hearts with love of RÃ¡ma thrill,â\\x80\\x94\\nThe worldâ\\x80\\x99s delight, so rich and fair,â\\x80\\x94\\nGrieved for the king, his death will share.\\nThe hopes he fondly cherished, crossed\\nAyodhyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s throne to RÃ¡ma lost,â\\x80\\x94\\nWith mournful cries, Too late, too late!\\nThe king my sire will meet his fate.\\nAnd when my sire has passed away,\\nMost happy in their lot are they,\\nAllowed, with every pious care,\\nPart in his funeral rites to bear.\\nAnd O, may we with joy at last,â\\x80\\x94\\nThese years of forest exile past,â\\x80\\x94\\nTurn to AyodhyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s town to dwell\\nWith him who keeps his promise well!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  While thus the hero mighty-souled,\\nIn wild lament his sorrow told,\\nFaint with the load that on him lay,\\nThe hours of darkness passed away.\\nAs thus the prince, impelled by zeal\\nFor his loved brother, prompt to feel\\nStrong yearnings for the peopleâ\\x80\\x99s weal,\\n  His words of truth outspake,\\nKing Guha grieved to see his woe,\\nHeart-stricken, gave his tears to flow,\\nTormented by the common blow,\\n  Sad, as a wounded snake.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LII. The Crossing Of GangÃ¡.\\n\\n\\nSoon as the shades of night had fled,\\nUprising from his lowly bed,\\nRÃ¡ma the famous, broad of chest,\\nHis brother Lakshmaá¹\\x87 thus addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow

hied\\nDown the broad riverâ\\x80\\x99s shelving side.\\nThen with raised palms the charioteer,\\nIn lowly reverence drawing near,\\nCried thus to RÃ¡ma good and true:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow what remains for me to do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n  With his right hand, while answering\\n    The hero touched his friend:\\n  â\\x80\\x9cGo back,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand on the king\\n    With watchful care

Sumantra, when, with grieving heart,\\nHe heard the hero bid him part,\\nThus to the bravest of the brave,\\nIkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s son, his answer gave:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn all the world men tell of

the three,\\nFrom Lakshmaá¹\\x87, SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, and from me,\\nMy mother, Queen KauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡, greet\\nWith reverence to her sacred feet.\\nAnd add this prayer of mine: â\\x80\\x9cO King;\\nSend quickly forth and Bharat bring,\\nAnd set him on the royal throne\\nWhich thy decree has made his own.\\nWhen he upon the throne is placed,\\nWhen thy fond arms are round him laced,\\nThine aged heart will cease to ache\\nWith bitter pangs for RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s sake.â\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd say to Bharat: â\\x80\\x9cSee thou treat\\nThe queens with all observance meet:\\nWhat care the king receives, the

mournful town to see:\\nWhere sick at heart the people are\\nBecause their RÃ¡ma roams afar.\\nWoe will be theirs too deep to brook\\nWhen on the empty car they look,\\nAs when from hosts, whose chiefs are slain,\\nOne charioteer comes home again.\\nThis very day, I ween, is food\\nForsworn by all the multitude,\\nThinking that thou, with hosts to aid,\\nArt dwelling in the wild woodâ\\x80\\x99s shade.\\nThe great despair, the shriek of woe\\nThey uttered when they saw thee go,\\nWill, when I come with none beside,\\nA hundred-fold be multiplied.\\nHow to KauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡ can I say:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO Queen, I took thy son away,\\nAnd with thy brother left him well:\\nWeep not for him; thy woe dispel?â\\x80\\x9d\\nSo false a tale I cannot frame,\\nYet how speak truth and grieve

cannot, no,\\nI cannot to AyodhyÃ¡ go.\\nThen deign, O RÃ¡ma, to relent,\\nAnd let me share thy banishment.\\nBut if no prayers can move thy heart,\\nIf thou wilt quit me and depart,\\nThe flames shall end my car and me,\\nDeserted thus and reft of thee.\\nIn the wild wood when foes are near,\\nWhen dangers check thy vows austere,\\nBorne in my car will I attend,\\nAll danger and all care to end.\\nFor thy dear sake I love the skill\\nThat guides the steed and curbs his will:\\nAnd soon a forest life will be\\nAs pleasant, for my love of thee.\\nAnd if these horses near thee dwell,\\nAnd serve thee in the forest well,\\nThey, for their service, will not miss\\nThe due reward of highest bliss.\\nThine orders, as with thee I stray,\\nWill I with heart and head obey,\\nPrepared, for thee, without a sigh,\\nTo lose AyodhyÃ¡ or the sky.\\nAs one defiled with hideous sin,\\nI never more can pass within\\nAyodhyÃ¡, city of our king,\\nUnless beside me thee I bring.\\nOne wish is mine, I ask no more,\\nThat, when thy banishment is oâ\\x80\\x99er\\nI in my car may bear my lord,\\nTriumphant, to his home restored.\\nThe fourteen years, if spent with thee,\\nWill swift as

thee go.\\nSoon as KaikeyÃ\\xad, youngest queen,\\nThy coming to the town has seen,\\nNo doubt will then her mind oppress\\nThat RÃ¡ma roams the wilderness.\\nAnd so the dame, her heart content\\nWith proof of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s banishment,\\nWill doubt the virtuous king no more\\nAs faithless to the oath he swore.\\nChief of my cares is this, that she,\\nYoungest amid the queens, may see\\nBharat her son securely reign\\nOâ\\x80\\x99er rich AyodhyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s wide domain.\\nFor mine and for the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s sake\\nDo thou thy journey homeward take,\\nAnd, as I bade, repeat each word\\nThat from my lips thou here hast heard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus spake the prince, and strove to cheer\\nThe sad heart of the charioteer,\\nAnd then to royal Guha said\\nThese words most wise and spirited:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGuha, dear friend, it is not meet\\nThat people throng my calm retreat:\\nFor I must live a strict recluse,\\nAnd mould my life by hermitsâ\\x80\\x99 use.\\nI now the ancient rule accept\\nBy good ascetics gladly kept.\\nI go: bring fig-tree juice that I\\nIn matted coils my hair may tie.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Quick Guha hastened to produce,\\nFor the kingâ\\x80\\x99s son, that sacred juice.\\nThen RÃ¡ma of his long locks made,\\nAnd Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s too, the hermit braid.\\nAnd the two royal brothers there\\nWith coats of bark and matted hair,\\nTransformed in lovely likeness stood\\nTo hermit saints who love the wood.\\nSo RÃ¡ma, with his brother bold,\\nA pious anchorite enrolled,\\nObeyed the vow which hermits take,\\nAnd to his friend, King Guha, spake:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay people, treasure, army share,\\nAnd fenced forts, thy constant care:\\nAttend to all: supremely hard\\nThe sovereignâ\\x80\\x99s task, to watch and guard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  IkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s son, the good and brave,\\nThis last farewell to Guha gave,\\nAnd then, with Lakshmaá¹\\x87 and his bride,\\nDetermined, on his way he hied.\\nSoon as he viewed, upon the shore,\\nThe bark prepared to waft them oâ\\x80\\x99er\\nImpetuous GangÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s rolling tide,\\nTo Lakshmaá¹\\x87 thus the chieftain cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBrother, embark; thy hand extend,\\nThy gentle aid to SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ lend:\\nWith care her trembling footsteps guide,\\nAnd place the lady by thy side.â\\x80\\x9d\\nWhen Lakshmaá¹\\x87 heard, prepared to aid,\\nHis brotherâ\\x80\\x99s words he swift obeyed.\\nWithin the bark he placed the dame,\\nThen to her side the hero came.\\nNext Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s elder brother, lord\\nOf brightest glory, when on board,\\nBreathing a prayer for blessings, meet\\nFor priest or warrior to repeat,\\nThen he and car-borne Lakshmaá¹\\x87 bent,\\nWell-pleased, their heads, most reverent,\\nTheir hands, with SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, having dipped,\\nAs Scripture bids, and water sipped,\\nFarewell to wise Sumantra said,\\nAnd Guha, with the train he led.\\nSo RÃ¡ma took, on board, his stand,\\nAnd urged the vessel from the land.\\nThen swift by vigorous arms impelled\\nHer onward course the vessel held,\\nAnd guided by the helmsman through\\nThe dashing waves of GangÃ¡ flew.\\nHalf way across the flood they came,\\nWhen SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, free from spot and blame,\\nHer reverent hands together pressed,\\nThe Goddess of the stream addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay the great chieftain here who springs\\nFrom DaÅ\\x9baratha, best of kings,\\nProtected by thy care, fulfil\\nHis prudent fatherâ\\x80\\x99s royal will.\\nWhen in the forest he has spent\\nHis fourteen years of banishment,\\nWith his dear brother and with me\\nHis home again my lord shall see.\\nReturning on that blissful day,\\nI will to thee mine offerings pay,\\nDear Queen, whose waters gently flow,\\nWho canst all blessed gifts bestow.\\nFor, three-pathed Queen, though wandering here,\\nThy waves descend from BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s sphere,\\nSpouse of the God oâ\\x80\\x99er floods supreme,\\nThough rolling here thy glorious stream.\\nTo thee, fair Queen, my head shall bend,\\nTo thee shall hymns of praise ascend,\\nWhen my brave lord shall turn again,\\nAnd, joyful, oâ\\x80\\x99er his kingdom reign.\\nTo win thy grace, O Queen divine,\\nA hundred thousand fairest kine,\\nAnd precious robes and finest meal\\nAmong the BrÃ¡hmans will I deal.\\nA hundred jars of wine shall flow,\\nWhen to my home, O Queen, I go;\\nWith these, and flesh, and corn, and rice,\\nWill I, delighted, sacrifice.\\nEach hallowed spot, each holy shrine\\nThat stands on these fair shores of thine,\\nEach fane and altar on thy banks\\nShall share my offerings and thanks.\\nWith me and Lakshmaá¹\\x87, free from harm,\\nMay he the blameless, strong of arm,\\nReseek AyodhyÃ¡ from the wild,\\nO blameless Lady undefiled!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  As, praying for her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s sake,\\nThe faultless dame to GangÃ¡ spake,\\nTo the right bank the vessel flew\\nWith her whose heart was right and true.\\nSoon as the bark had crossed the wave,\\nThe lion leader of the brave,\\nLeaving the vessel on the strand,\\nWith wife and brother leapt to land.\\nThen RÃ¡ma thus the prince addressed\\nWho filled with joy SumitrÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s breast:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe thine alike to guard and aid\\nIn peopled spot, in lonely shade.\\nDo thou, SumitrÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s son, precede:\\nLet SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ walk where thou shalt lead.\\nBehind you both my place shall be,\\nTo guard the Maithil dame and thee.\\nFor she, to woe a stranger yet,\\nNo toil or grief till now has met;\\nThe fair Videhan will assay\\nThe pains of forest life to-day.\\nTo-day her tender feet must tread\\nRough rocky wilds around her spread:\\nNo tilth is there, no gardens grow,\\nNo crowding people come and go.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The hero ceased: and Lakshmaá¹\\x87 led\\nObedient to the words he said:\\nAnd SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ followed him, and then\\nCame Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s pride, the lord of men.\\nWith SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ walking oâ\\x80\\x99er the sand\\nThey sought the forest, bow in hand,\\nBut still their lingering glances threw\\nWhere yet Sumantra stood in view.\\nSumantra, when his watchful eye\\nThe royal youths no more could spy,\\nTurned from the spot whereon he stood\\nHomeward with Guha from the wood.\\nStill on the brothers forced their way\\nWhere sweet birds sang on every spray,\\nThough scarce the eye a path could find\\nMid flowering trees where creepers twined.\\nFar on the princely brothers pressed,\\nAnd stayed their feet at length to rest\\nBeneath a fig treeâ\\x80\\x99s mighty shade\\nWith countless pendent shoots displayed.\\nReclining there a while at ease,\\nThey saw, not far, beneath fair trees\\nA lake with many a lotus bright\\nThat bore the name of Lovely Sight.\\nRÃ¡ma his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s attention drew,\\nAnd Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s, to the charming view:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook, brother, look how fair the flood\\nGlows with the lotus, flower and bud!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  They drank the water fresh and clear,\\nAnd with their shafts they slew a deer.\\nA fire of boughs they made in haste,\\nAnd in the flame the meat they placed.\\nSo Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s sons with SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ shared\\nThe hunterâ\\x80\\x99s meal their hands prepared,\\nThen counselled that the spreading tree\\nTheir shelter and their home should be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LIII.

BharadvÃ¡jaâ\\x80\\x99s Hermitage.\\n\\n\\nSo there that night the heroes spent\\nUnder the boughs that oâ\\x80\\x99er them bent,\\nAnd when the sun his glory spread,\\nUpstarting, from the place they sped.\\nOn to that spot they made their way,\\nThrough the dense wood that round them lay,\\nWhere YamunÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s(326) swift waters glide\\nTo blend with GangÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s holy tide.\\nCharmed with the prospect ever new\\nThe glorious heroes wandered through\\nFull many a spot of pleasant ground,\\nRejoicing as they gazed around,\\nWith eager eye and heart at ease,\\nOn countless sorts of flowery trees.\\nAnd now the day was half-way sped\\nWhen thus to Lakshmaá¹\\x87 RÃ¡ma said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, there, dear brother, turn thine eyes;\\nSee near PrayÃ¡g(327) that smoke arise:\\nThe banner of our Lord of Flames\\nThe dwelling of some saint proclaims.\\nNear to the place our steps we bend\\nWhere YamunÃ¡ and GangÃ¡ blend.\\nI hear and mark the deafening roar\\nWhen chafing floods together pour.\\nSee, near us on the ground are left\\nDry logs, by labouring woodmen cleft,\\nAnd the tall trees, that blossom near\\nSaint BharadvÃ¡jaâ\\x80\\x99s home, appear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The bow-armed princes onward passed,\\nAnd as the sun was sinking fast\\nThey reached the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s dwelling, set\\nNear where the rushing waters met.\\nThe presence of the warrior scared\\nThe deer and birds as on he fared,\\nAnd struck them with unwonted awe:\\nThen BharadvÃ¡jaâ\\x80\\x99s cot they saw.\\nThe high-souled hermit soon they found\\nGirt by his dear disciples round:\\nCalm saint, whose vows had well been wrought,\\nWhose fervent rites keen sight had bought.\\nDuly had flames of worship blazed\\nWhen RÃ¡ma on the hermit gazed:\\nHis suppliant hands the hero raised,\\nDrew nearer to the holy man\\nWith his companions, and began,\\nDeclaring both his name and race\\nAnd why they sought that distant place:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSaint, DaÅ\\x9barathaâ\\x80\\x99s children we,\\nRÃ¡ma and Lakshmaá¹\\x87, come to thee.\\nThis my good wife from Janak springs,\\nThe best of fair Videhaâ\\x80\\x99s kings;\\nThrough lonely wilds, a faultless dame,\\nTo this pure

by my father forth to rove,\\nWe seek, O Saint, some holy grove,\\nWhere lives of hermits we may lead,\\nAnd upon fruits and berries feed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  When BharadvÃ¡ja, prudent-souled,\\nHad heard the prince his tale unfold,\\nWater he bade them bring, a bull,\\nAnd honour-gifts in dishes full,\\nAnd drink and food of varied taste,\\nBerries and roots, before him placed,\\nAnd then the great ascetic showed\\nA cottage for the guestsâ\\x80\\x99 abode.\\nThe saint these honours gladly paid\\nTo RÃ¡ma who had thither strayed,\\nThen compassed sat by birds and deer\\nAnd many a hermit resting near.\\nThe prince received the service kind,\\nAnd sat him down rejoiced in mind.\\nThen BharadvÃ¡ja silence broke,\\nAnd thus the words of duty spoke:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKakutsthaâ\\x80\\x99s royal son, that thou\\nHadst sought this grove I knew ere now.\\nMine ears have heard thy story, sent\\nWithout a sin to banishment.\\nBehold, O Prince, this ample space\\nNear where the mingling floods embrace,\\nHoly, and beautiful, and clear:\\nDwell with us, and be happy here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  By BharadvÃ¡ja thus addressed,\\nRÃ¡ma whose kind and tender breast\\nAll living things would bless and save,\\nIn gracious words his answer gave:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cMy honoured lord, this tranquil spot,\\nFair home of hermits, suits me not:\\nFor all the neighbouring people here\\nWill seek us when they know me near:\\nWith eager wish to look on me,\\nAnd the Videhan dame to see,\\nA crowd of rustics will intrude\\nUpon the holy solitude.\\nProvide, O gracious lord, I pray,\\nSome quiet home that lies away,\\nWhere my Videhan spouse may dwell\\nTasting the bliss deserved so well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The hermit heard the prayer he made:\\nA while in earnest thought he stayed,\\nAnd then in words like these expressed\\nHis answer to the chiefâ\\x80\\x99s request:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTen leagues away there stands a hill\\nWhere thou mayst live, if such thy will:\\nA holy mount, exceeding fair;\\nGreat saints have made their dwelling there:\\nThere great LangÃºrs(328) in thousands play,\\nAnd bears amid the thickets stray;\\nWide-known by ChitrakÃºá¹\\xadaâ\\x80\\x99s name,\\nIt rivals GandhamÃ¡danâ\\x80\\x99s(329) fame.\\nLong as the man that hill who seeks\\nGazes upon its sacred peaks,\\nTo holy things his soul he gives\\nAnd pure from thought of evil lives.\\nThere, while a hundred autumns fled,\\nHas many a saint with hoary head\\nSpent his pure life, and won the prize,\\nBy deep devotion, in the skies:\\nBest home, I ween, if such retreat,\\nFar from the ways of men, be sweet:\\nOr let thy years of exile flee\\nHere in this hermitage with me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus BharadvÃ¡ja spake, and trained\\nIn lore of duty, entertained\\nThe princes and the dame, and pressed\\nHis friendly gifts on every guest.\\n\\n  Thus to PrayÃ¡g the hero went,\\nThus saw the saint preÃ«minent,\\nAnd varied speeches heard and said:\\nThen holy night oâ\\x80\\x99er heaven was spread.\\nAnd RÃ¡ma took, by toil oppressed,\\nWith SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ and his brother, rest;\\nAnd so the night, with sweet content,\\nIn BharadvÃ¡jaâ\\x80\\x99s grove was spent.\\nBut when the dawn dispelled the night,\\nRÃ¡ma approached the anchorite,\\nAnd thus addressed the holy sire\\nWhose glory shone like kindled fire:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell have we spent, O truthful Sage,\\nThe night within thy hermitage:\\nNow let my lord his guests permit\\nFor their new home his grove to quit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then, as he saw the morning break,\\nIn answer BharadvÃ¡ja spake:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo forth to ChitrakÃºá¹\\xadaâ\\x80\\x99s hill,\\nWhere berries grow, and sweets distil:\\nFull well, I deem, that home will suit\\nThee, RÃ¡ma, strong and resolute.\\nGo forth, and ChitrakÃºá¹\\xada seek,\\nFamed mountain of the Varied Peak.\\nIn the wild woods that gird him round\\nAll creatures of the chase are found:\\nThou in the glades shalt see appear\\nVast herds of elephants and deer.\\nWith SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ there shalt thou delight\\nTo gaze upon the woody height;\\nThere with expanding heart to look\\nOn river, table-land, and brook,\\nAnd see the foaming torrent rave\\nImpetuous from the mountain cave.\\nAuspicious hill! where all day long\\nThe lapwingâ\\x80\\x99s cry, the KoÃ¯lâ\\x80\\x99s song\\n  Make all who listen gay:\\nWhere all is fresh and fair to see,\\nWhere elephants and deer roam free,\\n  There, as a hermit, stay.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LV. The Passage Of YamunÃ¡.\\n\\n\\nThe princely tamers of their foes\\nThus passed the night in calm repose,\\nThen to the hermit having bent\\nWith reverence, on their way they went.\\nHigh favour BharadvÃ¡ja showed,\\nAnd blessed them ready for the road.\\nWith such fond looks as fathers throw\\nOn their own sons, before they go.\\nThen spake the saint with glory bright\\nTo RÃ¡ma peerless in his might:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFirst, lords of men, direct your feet\\nWhere YamunÃ¡ and GangÃ¡ meet;\\nThen to the swift KÃ¡lindÃ\\xad(330) go,\\nWhose westward waves to GangÃ¡ flow.\\nWhen thou shalt see her lovely shore\\nWorn by their feet who hasten oâ\\x80\\x99er,\\nThen, Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, a raft prepare,\\nAnd cross the Sun born river there.\\nUpon her farther bank a tree,\\nNear to the landing wilt thou see.\\nThe blessed source of varied gifts,\\nThere her green boughs that Fig-tree lifts:\\nA tree where countless birds abide,\\nBy Å\\x9ayÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s name known far and wide.\\nSÃ\\xadtÃ¡, revere that holy shade:\\nThere be thy prayers for blessing prayed.\\nThence for a league your way pursue,\\nAnd a dark wood shall meet your view,\\nWhere tall bamboos their foliage show,\\nThe Gum-tree and the Jujube grow.\\nTo ChitrakÃºá¹\\xada have I oft\\nTrodden that path so smooth and soft,\\nWhere burning woods no traveller scare,\\nBut all is pleasant, green, and fair.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  When thus the guests their road had learned,\\nBack to his cot the hermit turned,\\nAnd RÃ¡ma, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ paid\\nTheir reverent thanks for courteous aid.\\nThus RÃ¡ma spake to Lakshmaá¹\\x87, when\\nThe saint had left the lords of men:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGreat store of bliss in sooth is ours\\nOn whom his love the hermit showers.â\\x80\\x9d\\nAs each to other wisely talked,\\nThe lion lords together walked\\nOn to KÃ¡lindÃ\\xadâ\\x80\\x99s woody shore;\\nAnd gentle SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ went before.\\nThey reached that flood, whose waters flee\\nWith rapid current to the sea;\\nTheir minds a while to thought they gave\\nAnd counselled how to cross the wave.\\nAt length, with logs together laid,\\nA mighty raft the brothers made.\\nThen dry bamboos across were tied,\\nAnd grass was spread from side to side.\\nAnd the great hero Lakshmaá¹\\x87 brought\\nCane and Rose-Apple boughs and wrought,\\nTrimming the branches smooth and neat,\\nFor SÃ\\xadtÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s use a pleasant seat.\\nAnd RÃ¡ma placed thereon his dame\\nTouched with a momentary shame,\\nResembling in her glorious mien\\nAll-thought-surpassing Fortuneâ\\x80\\x99s Queen.\\nThen RÃ¡ma hastened to dispose,\\nEach in its place, the skins and bows,\\nAnd by the fair Videhan laid\\nThe coats, the ornaments, and spade.\\nWhen SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ thus was set on board,\\nAnd all their gear was duly stored,\\nThe heroes each with vigorous hand,\\nPushed off the raft and left the land.\\nWhen half its way the raft had made,\\nThus SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ to KÃ¡lindÃ\\xad prayed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoddess, whose flood I traverse now,\\nGrant that my lord may keep his vow.\\nFor thee shall bleed a thousand kine,\\nA hundred jars shall pour their wine,\\nWhen RÃ¡ma sees that town again\\nWhere old IkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s children reign.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus to KÃ¡lindÃ\\xadâ\\x80\\x99s stream she sued\\nAnd prayed in suppliant attitude.\\nThen to the riverâ\\x80\\x99s bank the dame,\\nFervent in supplication, came.\\nThey left the raft that brought them oâ\\x80\\x99er,\\nAnd the thick wood that clothed the shore,\\nAnd to the Fig-tree Å\\x9ayÃ¡ma made\\nTheir way, so cool with verdant shade.\\nThen SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ viewed that best of trees,\\nAnd reverent spake in words like these:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHail, hail, O mighty tree! Allow\\nMy husband to complete his vow;\\nLet us returning, I entreat,\\nKauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡ and SumitrÃ¡ meet.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen with her hands together placed\\nAround the tree she duly paced.\\nWhen RÃ¡ma saw his blameless spouse\\nA suppliant under holy boughs,\\nThe gentle darling of his heart,\\nHe thus to Lakshmaá¹\\x87 spake apart:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBrother, by thee our way be led;\\nLet SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ close behind thee tread:\\nI, best of men, will grasp my bow,\\nAnd hindmost of the three will go.\\nWhat fruits soeâ\\x80\\x99er her fancy take,\\nOr flowers half hidden in the brake,\\nFor Janakâ\\x80\\x99s child forget not thou\\nTo gather from the brake or bough.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus on they fared.

each flowery tree\\nTouched with the fire of morning see:\\nThe KinÅ\\x9buk, now the Frosts are fled,â\\x80\\x94\\nHow glorious with his wreaths of red!\\nThe Bel-trees see, so loved of men,\\nHanging their boughs in every glen.\\nOâ\\x80\\x99erburthened with their fruit and flowers:\\nA plenteous store of food is ours.\\n  See, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, in the leafy trees,\\n    Whereâ\\x80\\x99er they make their home.\\n  Down hangs, the work of labouring bees\\n    The ponderous honeycomb.\\n  In the fair wood before us spread\\n    The startled wild-cock cries:\\n  Hark, where the flowers are soft to tread,\\n    The peacockâ\\x80\\x99s voice replies.\\n  Where elephants are roaming free,\\n    And sweet birdsâ\\x80\\x99 songs are loud,\\n  The glorious ChitrakÃºá¹\\xada see:\\n    His peaks are in the cloud.\\n  On fair smooth ground he stands displayed,\\n    Begirt by many a tree:\\n  O brother, in that holy shade\\n    How happy shall we be!â\\x80\\x9d(331)\\nThen RÃ¡ma, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, each\\nSpoke raising suppliant hands this speech\\nTo him, in woodland dwelling met,\\nVÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki, ancient anchoret:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO Saint, this mountain takes the mind,\\nWith creepers, trees of every kind,\\nWith fruit and roots abounding thus,\\nA pleasant life it offers us:\\nHere for a while we fain would stay,\\nAnd pass a season blithe and gay.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then the great saint, in duty trained,\\nWith honour gladly entertained:\\nHe gave his guests a welcome fair,\\nAnd bade them sit and rest them there,\\nRÃ¡ma of mighty arm and chest\\nHis faithful Lakshmaá¹\\x87 then addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBrother, bring hither from the wood\\nSelected timber strong and good,\\nAnd build therewith a little cot;\\nMy heart rejoices in the spot\\nThat lies beneath the mountainâ\\x80\\x99s side,\\nRemote, with water well supplied.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  SumitrÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s son his words obeyed,\\nBrought many a tree, and deftly made,\\nWith branches in the forest cut,\\nAs RÃ¡ma bade, a leafy hut.\\nThen RÃ¡ma, when the cottage stood\\nFair, firmly built, and walled with wood,\\nTo Lakshmaá¹\\x87 spake, whose eager mind\\nTo do his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s will inclined:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, Lakshmaá¹\\x87 as our cot is made,\\nMust sacrifice be duly paid\\nBy us, for lengthened life who hope,\\nWith venison of the antelope.\\nAway, O bright-eyed Lakshmaá¹\\x87, speed:\\nStruck by thy bow a deer must bleed:\\nAs Scripture bids, we must not slight\\nThe duty that commands the rite.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Lakshmaá¹\\x87, the chief whose arrows laid\\nHis foemen low, his word obeyed;\\nAnd RÃ¡ma thus again addressed\\nThe swift performer of his hest:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrepare the venison thou hast shot,\\nTo sacrifice for this our cot.\\nHaste, brother dear, for this the hour,\\nAnd this the day of certain power.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen glorious Lakshmaá¹\\x87 took the buck\\nHis arrow in the wood had struck;\\nBearing his mighty load he came,\\nAnd laid it in the kindled flame.\\nSoon as he saw the meat was done,\\nAnd that the juices ceased to run\\nFrom the broiled carcass, Lakshmaá¹\\x87 then\\nSpoke thus to RÃ¡ma best of men:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe carcass of the buck, entire,\\nIs ready dressed upon the fire.\\nNow be the sacred rites begun\\nTo please the God, thou godlike one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  RÃ¡ma the good, in ritual trained,\\nPure from the bath, with thoughts restrained,\\nHasted those verses to repeat\\nWhich make the sacrifice complete.\\nThe hosts celestial came in view,\\nAnd RÃ¡ma to the cot withdrew,\\nWhile a sweet sense of rapture stole\\nThrough the unequalled heroâ\\x80\\x99s soul.\\nHe paid the ViÅ\\x9bvedevas(332) due.\\nAnd Rudraâ\\x80\\x99s right, and Vishá¹\\x87uâ\\x80\\x99s too,\\nNor wonted blessings, to protect\\nTheir new-built home, did he neglect.\\nWith voice repressed he breathed the prayer,\\nBathed duly in the river fair,\\nAnd gave good offerings that remove\\nThe stain of sin, as texts approve.\\nAnd many an altar there he made,\\nAnd shrines, to suit the holy shade,\\nAll decked with woodland chaplets sweet,\\nAnd fruit and roots and roasted meat,\\nWith muttered prayer, as texts require,\\nWater, and grass and wood and fire.\\nSo RÃ¡ma, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ paid\\nTheir offerings to each God and shade,\\nAnd entered then their pleasant cot\\nThat bore fair signs of happy lot.\\nThey entered, the illustrious three,\\nThe well-set cottage, fair to see,\\nRoofed with the leaves of many a tree,\\n  And fenced from wind and rain:\\nSo, at their Father BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s call,\\nThe Gods of heaven, assembling all,\\nTo their own glorious council hall\\n  Advance in shining train.\\nSo, resting on that lovely hill,\\nNear the fair lily-covered rill,\\n  The happy prince forgot,\\nSurrounded by the birds and deer,\\nThe woe, the longing, and the fear\\n  That gloom the exileâ\\x80\\x99s lot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LVII. Sumantraâ\\x80\\x99s Return.\\n\\n\\nWhen RÃ¡ma reached the southern bank,\\nKing Guhaâ\\x80\\x99s heart with sorrow sank:\\nHe with Sumantra talked, and spent\\nWith his deep sorrow, homeward went.\\nSumantra, as the king decreed,\\nYoked to the car each noble steed,\\nAnd to AyodhyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s city sped\\nWith his sad heart disquieted.\\nOn lake and brook and scented grove\\nHis glances fell, as on he drove:\\nCity and village came in view\\nAs oâ\\x80\\x99er the road his coursers flew.\\nOn the third day the charioteer,\\nWhen now the hour of night was near,\\nCame to AyodhyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s gate, and found\\nThe city all in sorrow drowned.\\nTo him, in spirit quite cast down,\\nForsaken seemed the silent town,\\nAnd by the rush of grief oppressed\\nHe pondered in his mournful breast:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs all AyodhyÃ¡ burnt with grief,\\nSteed, elephant, and man, and chief?\\nDoes her loved RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s exile so\\nAfflict her with the fires of woe?â\\x80\\x9d\\nThus as he mused, his steeds flew fast,\\nAnd swiftly through the gate he passed.\\nOn drove the charioteer, and then\\nIn hundreds, yea in thousands, men\\nRan to the car from every side,\\nAnd, â\\x80\\x9cRÃ¡ma, where is RÃ¡ma?â\\x80\\x9d cried.\\nSumantra said: â\\x80\\x9cMy chariot bore\\nThe duteous prince to GangÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s shore;\\nI left him there at his behest,\\nAnd homeward to AyodhyÃ¡ pressed.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSoon as the anxious people knew\\nThat he was oâ\\x80\\x99er the flood they drew\\nDeep sighs, and crying, RÃ¡ma! all\\nWailed, and big tears began to fall.\\nHe heard the mournful words prolonged,\\nAs here and there the people thronged:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWoe, woe for us, forlorn, undone,\\nNo more to look on Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son!\\nHis like again we neâ\\x80\\x99er shall see,\\nOf heart so true, of hand so free,\\nIn gifts, in gatherings for debate,\\nWhen marriage pomps we celebrate,\\nWhat should we do? What earthly thing\\nCan rest, or hope, or pleasure bring?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus the sad town, which RÃ¡ma kept\\nAs a kind father, wailed and wept.\\nEach mansion, as the car went by,\\nSent forth a loud and bitter cry,\\nAs to the window every dame,\\nMourning for banished RÃ¡ma, came.\\nAs his sad eyes with tears oâ\\x80\\x99erflowed,\\nHe sped along the royal road\\nTo DaÅ\\x9barathaâ\\x80\\x99s high abode.\\nThere leaping down his car he stayed;\\nWithin the gates his way he made;\\nThrough seven broad courts he onward hied\\nWhere people thronged on every side.\\nFrom each high terrace, wild with woe,\\nThe royal ladies flocked below:\\nHe heard them talk in gentle tone,\\nAs each for RÃ¡ma made her moan:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat will the charioteer reply\\nTo Queen KauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s eager cry?\\nWith RÃ¡ma from the gates he went;\\nHomeward alone, his steps are bent.\\nHard is a life with woe distressed,\\nBut difficult to win is rest,\\nIf, when her son is banished, still\\nShe lives beneath her load of ill.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Such was the speech Sumantra heard\\nFrom them whom grief unfeigned had stirred.\\nAs fires of anguish burnt him through,\\nSwift to the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s hall he drew,\\nPast the eighth court; there met his sight,\\nThe sovereign in his palace bright,\\nStill weeping for his son, forlorn,\\nPale, faint, and all with sorrow worn.\\nAs there he sat, Sumantra bent\\nAnd did obeisance reverent,\\nAnd to the king repeated oâ\\x80\\x99er\\nThe message he from RÃ¡ma bore.\\nThe monarch heard, and well-nigh brake\\nHis heart, but yet no word he spake:\\nFainting to earth he fell, and dumb,\\nBy grief for RÃ¡ma overcome.\\nRang through the hall a startling cry,\\nAnd womenâ\\x80\\x99s arms were tossed on high,\\nWhen, with his senses all astray,\\nUpon the ground the monarch lay.\\nKauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡, with SumitrÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s aid,\\nRaised from the ground her lord dismayed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSire, of high fate,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9cO, why\\nDost thou no single word reply\\nTo RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s messenger who brings\\nNews of his painful wanderings?\\nThe great injustice done, art thou\\nShame-stricken for thy conduct now?\\nRise up, and do thy part: bestow\\nComfort and help in this our woe.\\nSpeak freely, King; dismiss thy fear,\\nFor Queen KaikeyÃ\\xad stands not near,\\nAfraid of whom thou wouldst not seek\\nTidings of RÃ¡ma: freely speak.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  When the sad queen had ended so,\\nShe sank, insatiate in her woe,\\nAnd prostrate lay upon the ground,\\nWhile her faint voice by sobs was drowned.\\nWhen all the ladies in despair\\nSaw Queen KauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡ wailing there,\\nAnd the poor king oppressed with pain,\\nThey flocked around and wept again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LVIII. RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s Message.\\n\\n\\nThe king a while had senseless lain,\\nWhen care brought memory back again.\\nThen straight he called, the news to hear\\nOf RÃ¡ma, for the charioteer,\\nWith reverent hand to hand applied\\nHe waited by the old manâ\\x80\\x99s side,\\nWhose mind with anguish was distraught\\nLike a great elephant newly caught.\\nThe king with bitter pain distressed\\nThe faithful charioteer addressed,\\nWho, sad of mien, with flooded eye,\\nAnd dust upon his limbs, stood by:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere will be RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s dwelling now\\nAt some treeâ\\x80\\x99s foot, beneath the bough;\\nAh, what will be the exileâ\\x80\\x99s food,\\nBred up with kind solicitude?\\nCan he, long lapped in pleasant rest,\\nUnmeet for pain, by pain oppressed,\\nSon of earthâ\\x80\\x99s king, his sad night spend\\nEarth-couched, as one that has no friend?\\nBehind him, when abroad he sped,\\nCars, elephant, and foot were led:\\nThen how shall RÃ¡ma dwell afar\\nIn the wild woods where no men are?\\nHow, tell me, did the princes there,\\nWith SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ good and soft and fair,\\nAlighting from the chariot, tread\\nThe forest wilds around them spread?\\nA happy lot is thine, I ween,\\nWhose eyes my two dear sons have seen\\nSeeking on foot the forest shade,\\nLike the bright Twins to view displayed,\\nThe heavenly AÅ\\x9bvins, when they seek\\nThe woods that hang â\\x80\\x99neath Mandarâ\\x80\\x99s peak.\\nWhat words, Sumantra, quickly tell,\\nFrom RÃ¡ma, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ fell?\\nHow in the wood did RÃ¡ma eat?\\nWhat was his bed, and what his seat?\\nFull answer to my questions give,\\nFor I on thy replies shall live,\\nAs with the saints YayÃ¡ti held\\nSweet converse, from the skies expelled.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Urged by the lord of men to speak,\\nWhose sobbing voice came faint and weak,\\nThus he, while tears his utterance broke,\\nIn answer to the monarch spoke:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHear then the words that RÃ¡ma said,\\nResolved in dutyâ\\x80\\x99s path to tread.\\nJoining his hands, his head he bent,\\nAnd gave this message, reverent:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSumantra, to my father go,\\nWhose lofty mind all people know:\\nBow down before him, as is meet,\\nAnd in my stead salute his feet.\\nThen to the queen my mother bend,\\nAnd give the greeting that I send:\\nNeâ\\x80\\x99er may her steps from duty err,\\nAnd may it still be well with her.\\nAnd add this word: â\\x80\\x9cO Queen, pursue\\nThy vows with faithful heart and true;\\nAnd ever at due season turn\\nWhere holy fires of worship burn.\\nAnd, lady, on our lord bestow\\nSuch honour as to Gods we owe.\\nBe kind to every queen: let pride\\nAnd thought of self be cast aside.\\nIn the kingâ\\x80\\x99s fond opinion raise\\nKaikeyÃ\\xad, by respect and

royal RÃ¡ma banished thence?\\nHe is the cause, the king: poor slave\\nTo the light charge KaikeyÃ\\xad gave.\\nLet right or wrong the motive be,\\nThe author of our woe is he.\\nWhether the exile were decreed\\nThrough foolish faith or guilty greed,\\nFor promises or empire, still\\nThe king has wrought a grievous ill.\\nGrant that the Lord of all saw fit\\nTo prompt the deed and sanction it,\\nIn RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s life no cause I see\\nFor which the king should bid him flee.\\nHis blinded eyes refused to scan\\nThe guilt and folly of the plan,\\nAnd from the weakness of the king\\nHere and hereafter woe shall spring.\\nNo more my sire: the ties that used\\nTo bind me to the king are loosed.\\nMy brother RÃ¡ma, Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son,\\nTo me is lord, friend, sire in one.\\nThe love of men how can he win,\\nDeserting, by the cruel sin,\\nTheir joy, whose heart is swift to feel\\nA pleasure in the peopleâ\\x80\\x99s weal?\\nShall he whose mandate could expel\\nThe virtuous RÃ¡ma, loved so well,\\nTo whom his subjectsâ\\x80\\x99 fond hearts clingâ\\x80\\x94\\nShall he in spite of them be king?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  But Janakâ\\x80\\x99s child, my lord, stood by,\\nAnd oft the votaress heaved a sigh.\\nShe seemed with dull and wandering sense,\\nBeneath a spiritâ\\x80\\x99s influence.\\nThe noble princess, pained with woe\\nWhich till that hour she neâ\\x80\\x99er could know,\\nTears in her heavy trouble shed,\\nBut not a word to me she said.\\nShe raised her face which grief had dried\\nAnd tenderly her husband eyed,\\nGazed on him as he turned to go\\nWhile tear chased tear in rapid flow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LIX. Dasarathaâ\\x80\\x99s Lament.\\n\\n\\nAs thus Sumantra, best of peers,\\nTold his sad tale with many tears,\\nThe monarch cried, â\\x80\\x9cI pray thee, tell\\nAt length again what there befell.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSumantra, at the kingâ\\x80\\x99s behest,\\nStriving with sobs he scarce repressed,\\nHis trembling voice at last controlled,\\nAnd thus his further tidings told:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheir locks in votive coils they wound,\\nTheir coats of bark upon them bound,\\nTo GangÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s farther shore they went,\\nThence to PrayÃ¡g their steps were bent.\\nI saw that Lakshmaá¹\\x87 walked ahead\\nTo guard the path the two should tread.\\nSo far I saw, no more could learn,\\nForced by the hero to return.\\nRetracing slow my homeward course,\\nScarce could I move each stubborn horse:\\nShedding hot tears of grief he stood\\nWhen RÃ¡ma turned him to the wood.(333)\\nAs the two princes parted thence\\nI raised my hands in reverence,\\nMounted my ready car, and bore\\nThe grief that stung me to the core.\\nWith Guha all that day I stayed,\\nStill by the earnest hope delayed\\nThat RÃ¡ma, ere the time should end,\\nSome message from the wood might send.\\nThy realms, great Monarch, mourn the blow,\\nAnd sympathize with RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s woe.\\nEach withering tree hangs low his head,\\nAnd shoot, and bud, and flower are dead.\\nDried are the floods that wont to fill\\nThe lake, the river, and the rill.\\nDrear is each grove and garden now,\\nDry every blossom on the bough.\\nEach beast is still, no serpents crawl:\\nA lethargy of woe on all.\\nThe very wood is silent: crushed\\nWith grief for RÃ¡ma, all is hushed.\\nFair blossoms from the water born,\\nGay garlands that the earth adorn,\\nAnd every fruit that gleams like gold,\\nHave lost the scent that charmed of old.\\nEmpty is every grove I see,\\nOr birds sit pensive on the tree.\\nWhereâ\\x80\\x99er I look, its beauty oâ\\x80\\x99er,\\nThe pleasance charms not as before.\\nI drove through fair AyodhyÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s street:\\nNone flew with joy the car to meet.\\nThey saw that RÃ¡ma was not there,\\nAnd turned them sighing in despair.\\nThe people in the royal way\\nWept tears of bitter grief, when they\\nBeheld me coming, from afar,\\nNo RÃ¡ma with me in the car.\\nFrom palace roof and turret high\\nEach woman bent her eager eye;\\nShe looked for RÃ¡ma, but in vain;\\nGazed on the car and shrieked for pain.\\nTheir long clear eyes with sorrow drowned\\nThey, when this common grief was found,\\nLooked each on other, friend and foe,\\nIn sympathy of levelling woe:\\nNo shade of difference between\\nFoe, friend, or neutral, there was seen.\\nWithout a joy, her bosom rent\\nWith grief for RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s banishment,\\nAyodhyÃ¡ like the queen appears\\nWho mourns her son with many tears.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He ended: and the king, distressed.\\nWith sobbing voice that lord addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh me, by false KaikeyÃ\\xad led,\\nOf evil race, to evil

womanâ\\x80\\x99s influence.\\nSurely, my lord, a woe so great\\nFalls on us by the will of Fate;\\nIt lays the house of Raghu low,\\nFor Destiny will have it so.\\nI pray thee, if I eâ\\x80\\x99er have done\\nAn act to please thee, yea, but one,\\nFly, fly, and RÃ¡ma homeward lead:\\nMy life, departing, counsels speed.\\nFly, ere the power to bid I lack,\\nFly to the wood: bring RÃ¡ma back.\\nI cannot live for even one\\nShort hour bereaved of my son.\\nBut ah, the prince, whose arms are strong,\\nHas journeyed far: the way is long:\\nMe, me upon the chariot place,\\nAnd let me look on RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\nAh me, my son, mine eldest-born,\\nWhere roams he in the wood forlorn,\\nThe wielder of the mighty bow,\\nWhose shoulders like the lionâ\\x80\\x99s show?\\nO, ere the light

absence makes it wide:\\nMy tears its foamy flood distain,\\nMade billowy by my sighs of pain:\\nMy cries its roar, the arms I throw\\nAbout me are the fish below,\\nKaikeyÃ\\xad is the fire that feeds\\nBeneath: my hair the tangled weeds:\\nIts source the tears for RÃ¡ma shed:\\nThe hump-backâ\\x80\\x99s words its monsters dread:\\nThe boon I gave the wretch its shore,\\nTill

at a sound to shoot.\\nAs regent prince I shared the throne,\\nThou wast a maid to me unknown,\\nThe early Rain-time duly came,\\nAnd strengthened loveâ\\x80\\x99s delicious flame.\\nThe sun had drained the earth that lay\\nAll glowing â\\x80\\x99neath the summer day,\\nAnd to the gloomy clime had fled\\nWhere dwell the spirits of the dead.(335)\\nThe fervent heat that moment ceased,\\nThe darkening clouds each hour increased\\nAnd frogs and deer and peacocks all\\nRejoiced to see the torrents fall.\\nTheir bright wings heavy from the shower,\\nThe birds, new-bathed, had scarce the power\\nTo reach the branches of the trees\\nWhose high tops swayed beneath the breeze.\\nThe fallen rain, and falling still,\\nHung like a sheet on every hill,\\nTill, with glad deer, each flooded steep\\nShowed glorious as the mighty deep.\\nThe torrents down its wooded side\\nPoured, some unstained, while others dyed\\nGold, ashy, silver, ochre, bore\\nThe tints of every mountain ore.\\nIn that sweet time, when all are pleased,\\nMy arrows and my bow I seized;\\nKeen for the chase, in field or grove,\\nDown SarjÃºâ\\x80\\x99s bank my car I drove.\\nI longed with all my lawless will\\nSome elephant by night to kill,\\nSome buffalo that came to drink,\\nOr tiger, at the riverâ\\x80\\x99s brink.\\nWhen all around was dark and still,\\nI heard a pitcher slowly fill,\\nAnd thought, obscured in deepest shade,\\nAn elephant the sound had made.\\nI drew a shaft that glittered bright,\\nFell as a serpentâ\\x80\\x99s venomed bite;\\nI longed to lay the monster dead,\\nAnd to the mark my arrow sped.\\nThen in the calm of morning, clear\\nA hermitâ\\x80\\x99s wailing smote my ear:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh me, ah me,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, and sank,\\nPierced by my arrow, on the bank.\\nEâ\\x80\\x99en as the weapon smote his side,\\nI heard a human voice that cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy lights this shaft on one like me,\\nA poor and harmless devotee?\\nI came by night to fill my jar\\nFrom this lone stream where no men are.\\nAh, who this deadly shaft has shot?\\nWhom have I wronged, and knew it not?\\nWhy should a boy so harmless feel\\nThe vengeance of the winged steel?\\nOr who should slay the guiltless son\\nOf hermit sire who injures none,\\nWho dwells retired in woods, and there\\nSupports his life on woodland fare?\\nAh me, ah me, why am I slain,\\nWhat booty will the murderer gain?\\nIn hermit coils I bind my hair,\\nCoats made of skin and bark I wear.\\nAh, who the cruel deed can praise\\nWhose idle toil no fruit repays,\\nAs impious as the wretchâ\\x80\\x99s crime\\nWho dares his masterâ\\x80\\x99s bed to climb?\\nNor does my parting spirit grieve\\nBut for the life which thus I leave:\\nAlas, my mother and my sire,â\\x80\\x94\\nI mourn for them when I expire.\\nAh me, that aged, helpless pair,\\nLong cherished by my watchful care,\\nHow will it be with them this day\\nWhen to the Five(336) I pass away?\\nPierced by the self-same dart we die,\\nMine aged mother, sire, and I.\\nWhose mighty hand, whose lawless mind\\nHas all the three to death consigned?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  When I, by love of duty stirred,\\nThat touching lamentation heard,\\nPierced to the heart by sudden woe,\\nI threw to earth my shafts and bow.\\nMy heart was full of grief and dread\\nAs swiftly to the place I sped,\\nWhere, by my arrow wounded sore,\\nA hermit lay on SarjÃºâ\\x80\\x99s shore.\\nHis matted hair was all unbound,\\nHis pitcher empty on the ground,\\nAnd by the fatal arrow pained,\\nHe lay with dust and gore distained.\\nI stood confounded and amazed:\\nHis dying eyes to mine he raised,\\nAnd spoke this speech in accents stern,\\nAs though his light my soul would burn:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow have I wronged thee, King, that I\\nStruck by thy mortal arrow die?\\nThe wood my home, this jar I brought,\\nAnd water for my parents sought.\\nThis one keen shaft that strikes me through\\nSlays sire and aged mother too.\\nFeeble and blind, in helpless pain,\\nThey wait for me and thirst in vain.\\nThey with parched lips their pangs must bear,\\nAnd hope will end in blank despair.\\nAh me, there seems no fruit in store\\nFor holy zeal or Scripture lore,\\nOr else ere now my sire would know\\nThat his dear son is lying low.\\nYet, if my mournful fate he knew,\\nWhat could his arm so feeble do?\\nThe tree, firm-rooted, neâ\\x80\\x99er may be\\nThe guardian of a stricken tree.\\nHaste to my father, and relate\\nWhile time allows, my sudden fate,\\nLest he consume thee as the fire\\nBurns up the forest, in his ire.\\nThis little path, O King, pursue:\\nMy fatherâ\\x80\\x99s cot thou soon wilt view.\\nThere sue for pardon to the sage,\\nLest he should curse thee in his rage.\\nFirst from the wound extract the dart\\nThat kills me with its deadly smart,\\nEâ\\x80\\x99en as the flushed impetuous tide\\nEats through the riverâ\\x80\\x99s yielding side.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  I feared to draw the arrow out,\\nAnd pondered thus in painful doubt:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow tortured by the shaft he lies,\\nBut if I draw it forth he dies.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHelpless I stood, faint, sorely grieved:\\nThe hermitâ\\x80\\x99s son my thought perceived;\\nAs one oâ\\x80\\x99ercome by direst pain\\nHe scarce had strength to speak again.\\nWith writhing limb and struggling breath,\\nNearer and ever nearer death\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy senses undisturbed remain,\\nAnd fortitude has conquered pain:\\nNow from one tear thy soul be freed.\\nThy hand has made a BrÃ¡hman bleed.\\nLet not this pang thy bosom wring:\\nNo twice-born youth am I, O King,\\nFor of a VaiÅ\\x9bya sire I came,\\nWho wedded with a Å\\x9aÃºdra dame.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  These words the boy could scarcely say,\\nAs tortured by the shaft he lay,\\nTwisting his helpless body round,\\nThen trembling senseless on the ground.\\nThen from his bleeding side I drew\\nThe rankling shaft that pierced him through.\\nWith deathâ\\x80\\x99s last fear my face he eyed,\\nAnd, rich in store of penance, died.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LXIV. Dasarathaâ\\x80\\x99s Death.\\n\\n\\nThe son of Raghu to his queen\\nThus far described the unequalled scene,\\nAnd, as the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s death he rued,\\nThe mournful story thus renewed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe deed my heedless hand had wrought\\nPerplexed me with remorseful thought,\\nAnd all alone I pondered still\\nHow kindly deed might salve the ill.\\nThe pitcher from the ground I took,\\nAnd filled it from that fairest brook,\\nThen, by the path the hermit showed,\\nI reached his sainted sireâ\\x80\\x99s abode.\\nI came, I saw: the aged pair,\\nFeeble and blind, were sitting there,\\nLike birds with clipped wings, side by side,\\nWith none their helpless steps to guide.\\nTheir idle hours the twain beguiled\\nWith talk of their returning child,\\nAnd still the cheering hope enjoyed,\\nThe hope, alas, by me destroyed.\\nThen spoke the sage, as drawing near\\nThe sound of footsteps reached his ear:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear son, the water quickly bring;\\nWhy hast thou made this tarrying?\\nThy mother thirsts, and thou hast played,\\nAnd bathing in the brook delayed.\\nShe weeps because thou camest not;\\nHaste, O my son, within the cot.\\nIf she or I have ever done\\nA thing to pain thee, dearest son,\\nDismiss the memory from thy mind:\\nA hermit thou, be good and kind.\\nOn thee our lives, our all, depend:\\nThou art thy friendless parentsâ\\x80\\x99 friend.\\nThe eyeless coupleâ\\x80\\x99s eye art thou:\\nThen why so cold and silent now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  With sobbing voice and bosom wrung\\nI scarce could move my faltering tongue,\\nAnd with my spirit filled with dread\\nI looked upon the sage, and said,\\nWhile mind, and sense, and nerve I strung\\nTo fortify my trembling tongue,\\nAnd let the aged hermit know\\nHis sonâ\\x80\\x99s sad fate, my fear and woe:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHigh-minded Saint, not I thy child,\\nA warrior, DaÅ\\x9baratha styled.\\nI bear a grievous sorrowâ\\x80\\x99s weight\\nBorn of a deed which good men hate.\\nMy lord, I came to SarjÃºâ\\x80\\x99s shore,\\nAnd in my hand my bow I bore\\nFor elephant or beast of chase\\nThat seeks by night his drinking place.\\nThere from the stream a sound I heard\\nAs if a jar the water stirred.\\nAn elephant, I thought, was nigh:\\nI aimed, and let an arrow fly.\\nSwift to the place I made my way,\\nAnd there a wounded hermit lay\\nGasping for breath: the deadly dart\\nStood quivering in his youthful heart.\\nI hastened near with pain oppressed;\\nHe faltered out his last behest.\\nAnd quickly, as he bade me do,\\nFrom his pierced side the shaft I drew.\\nI drew the arrow from the rent,\\nAnd up to heaven the hermit went,\\nLamenting, as from earth he passed,\\nHis aged parents to the last.\\nThus, unaware, the deed was done:\\nMy hand, unwitting, killed thy son.\\nFor what remains, O, let me win\\nThy pardon for my heedless sin.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  As the sad tale of sin I told\\nThe hermitâ\\x80\\x99s grief was uncontrolled.\\nWith flooded eyes, and sorrow-faint,\\nThus spake the venerable saint:\\nI stood with hand to hand applied,\\nAnd listened as he spoke and sighed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf thou, O King, hadst left unsaid\\nBy thine own tongue this tale of dread,\\nThy head for hideous guilt accursed\\nHad in a thousand pieces burst.\\nA hermitâ\\x80\\x99s blood by warrior spilt,\\nIn such a case, with purposed guilt,\\nDown from his high estate would bring\\nEven the thunderâ\\x80\\x99s mighty King.\\nAnd he a dart who conscious sends\\nAgainst the devotee who spends\\nHis pure life by the law of Heavenâ\\x80\\x94\\nThat sinnerâ\\x80\\x99s head will split in seven.\\nThou livest, for thy heedless hand\\nHas wrought a deed thou hast not planned,\\nElse thou and all of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s line\\nHad perished by this act of thine.\\nNow guide us,â\\x80\\x9d thus the hermit said,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cForth to the spot where he lies dead.\\nGuide us, this day, O Monarch, we\\nFor the last time our son would see:\\nThe hermit dress of skin he wore\\nRent from his limbs distained with gore;\\nHis senseless body lying slain,\\nHis soul in Yamaâ\\x80\\x99s dark domain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Alone the mourning pair I led,\\nTheir souls with woe disquieted,\\nAnd let the dame and hermit lay\\nTheir hands upon the breathless clay.\\nThe father touched his son, and pressed\\nThe body to his aged breast;\\nThen falling by the dead boyâ\\x80\\x99s side,\\nHe lifted up his voice, and cried:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cHast thou no word, my child, to say?\\nNo greeting for thy sire to-day?\\nWhy art thou angry, darling? why\\nWilt thou upon the cold earth lie?\\nIf thou, my son, art wroth with me,\\nHere, duteous child, thy mother see.\\nWhat! no embrace for me, my son?\\nNo word of tender loveâ\\x80\\x94not one?\\nWhose gentle voice, so soft and clear,\\nSoothing my spirit, shall I hear\\nWhen evening comes, with accents sweet\\nScripture or ancient lore repeat?\\nWho, having fed the sacred fire,\\nAnd duly bathed, as texts require,\\nWill cheer, when evening rites are done,\\nThe father mourning for his son?\\nWho will the daily meal provide\\nFor the poor wretch who lacks a guide,\\nFeeding the helpless with the best\\nBerries and roots, like some dear guest?\\nHow can these hands subsistence find\\nFor thy poor mother, old and blind?\\nThe wretched votaress how sustain,\\nWho mourns her child in ceaseless pain?\\nStay yet a while, my darling, stay,\\nNor fly to Yamaâ\\x80\\x99s realm to-day.\\nTo-morrow I thy sire and she\\nWho bare thee, child, will go with, thee.(337)\\nThen when I look on Yama, I\\nTo great Vivasvatâ\\x80\\x99s son will cry:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHear, King of justice, and restore\\nOur child to feed us, I implore.\\nLord of the world, of mighty fame,\\nFaithful and just, admit my claim,\\nAnd grant this single boon to free\\nMy soul from fear, to one like me.â\\x80\\x9d\\nBecause, my son, untouched by stain,\\nBy sinful hands thou fallest slain,\\nWin, through thy truth, the sphere where those\\nWho die by hostile darts repose.\\nSeek the blest home prepared for all\\nThe valiant who in battle fall,\\nWho face the foe and scorn to yield,\\nIn glory dying on the field.\\nRise to the heaven where DhundhumÃ¡r\\nAnd Nahush, mighty heroes, are,\\nWhere Janamejay and the blest\\nDilÃ\\xadpa, Sagar, Saivya, rest:\\nHome of all virtuous spirits, earned\\nBy fervent rites and Scripture learned:\\nBy those whose sacred fires have glowed,\\nWhose liberal hands have fields bestowed:\\nBy givers of a thousand cows,\\nBy lovers of one faithful spouse:\\nBy those who serve their masters well,\\nAnd cast away this earthly shell.\\nNone of my race can ever know\\nThe bitter pain of lasting woe.\\nBut doomed to that dire fate is he\\nWhose guilty hand has slaughtered thee.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus with wild tears the aged saint\\nMade many a time his piteous plaint,\\nThen with his wife began to shed\\nThe funeral water for the dead.\\nBut in a shape celestial clad,\\nWon by the merits of the lad,\\nThe spirit from the body brake\\nAnd to the mourning parents spake:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA glorious home in realms above\\nRewards my care and filial love.\\nYou, honoured parents, soon shall be\\nPartakers of that home with me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He spake, and swiftly mounting high,\\nWith Indra near him, to the sky\\nOn a bright car, with flame that glowed,\\nSublime the duteous hermit rode.\\n\\n  The father, with his consortâ\\x80\\x99s aid,\\nThe funeral rites with water paid,\\nAnd thus his speech to me renewed\\nWho stood in suppliant attitude:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSlay me this day, O, slay me, King,\\nFor death no longer has a sting.\\nChildless am I: thy dart has done\\nTo death my dear, my only son.\\nBecause the boy I loved so well\\nSlain by thy heedless arrow fell,\\nMy curse upon thy soul shall press\\nWith bitter woe and heaviness.\\nI mourn a slaughtered child, and thou\\nShalt feel the pangs that kill me now.\\nBereft and suffering eâ\\x80\\x99en as I,\\nSo shalt thou mourn thy son, and die.\\nThy hand unwitting dealt the blow\\nThat laid a holy hermit low,\\nAnd distant, therefore, is the time\\nWhen thou shalt suffer for the crime.\\nThe hour shall come when, crushed by woes\\nLike these I feel, thy life shall close:\\nA debt to pay in after days\\nLike his the priestly fee who pays.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  This curse on me the hermit laid,\\nNor yet his tears and groans were stayed.\\nThen on the pyre their bodies cast\\nThe pair; and straight to heaven they passed.\\nAs in sad thought I pondered long\\nBack to my memory came the wrong\\nDone in wild youth, O lady dear,\\nWhen â\\x80\\x99twas my boast to shoot by ear.\\nThe deed has borne the fruit, which now\\nHangs ripe upon the bending bough:\\nThus dainty meats the palate please,\\nAnd lure the weak to swift disease.\\nNow on my soul return with dread\\nThe words that noble hermit said,\\nThat I for a dear son should grieve,\\nAnd of the woe my life should leave.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus spake the king with many a tear;\\nThen to his wife he cried in fear:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot see thee, love; but lay\\nThy gentle hand in mine, I pray.\\nAh me, if RÃ¡ma touched me thus,\\nIf once, returning home to us,\\nHe bade me wealth and lordship give,\\nThen, so I think, my soul would live.\\nUnlike myself, unjust and mean\\nHave been my ways with him, my Queen,\\nBut like himself is all that he,\\nMy noble son, has done to me.\\nHis son, though far from right he stray,\\nWhat prudent sire would cast away?\\nWhat banished son would check his ire,\\nNor speak reproaches of his sire?\\nI see thee not: these eyes grow blind,\\nAnd memory quits my troubled mind.\\nAngels of Death are round me: they\\nSummon my soul with speed away.\\nWhat woe more grievous can there be,\\nThat, when from light and life I flee,\\nI may not, ere I part, behold\\nMy virtuous RÃ¡ma, true and bold?\\nGrief for my son, the brave and true,\\nWhose joy it was my will to do,\\nDries up my breath, as summer dries\\nThe last drop in the pool that lies.\\nNot men, but blessed Gods, are they\\nWhose eyes shall see his face that day;\\nSee him, when fourteen years are past,\\nWith earrings decked return at last.\\nMy fainting mind forgets to think:\\nLow and more low my spirits sink.\\nEach from its seat, my senses steal:\\nI cannot hear, or taste, or feel.\\nThis lethargy of soul oâ\\x80\\x99ercomes\\nEach organ, and its function numbs:\\nSo when the oil begins to fail,\\nThe torchâ\\x80\\x99s rays grow faint and pale.\\nThis flood of woe caused by this hand\\nDestroys me helpless and unmanned,\\nResistless as the floods that bore\\nA passage through the river shore.\\nAh Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, ah mighty-armed,\\nBy whom my cares were soothed and charmed,\\nMy son in whom I took delight,\\nNow vanished from thy fatherâ\\x80\\x99s sight!\\nKauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡, ah, I cannot see;\\nSumitrÃ¡, gentle devotee!\\nAlas, KaikeyÃ\\xad, cruel dame,\\nMy bitter foe, thy fatherâ\\x80\\x99s shame!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  KauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡ and SumitrÃ¡ kept\\nTheir watch beside him as he wept.\\nAnd DaÅ\\x9baratha moaned and sighed,\\nAnd grieving for his darling

responsive to the quill,\\nLoved by the happy, hushed and still?\\nMy boding spirit gathers hence\\nDire sins of awful consequence,\\nAnd omens, crowding on my sight,\\nWeigh down my soul with wild affright.\\nScarce shall I find my friends who dwell\\nHere in AyodhyÃ¡ safe and well:\\nFor surely not without a cause\\nThis crushing dread my soul oâ\\x80\\x99erawes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Heart sick,

there,\\nNo grateful incense loads the air,\\nAnd all therein, with brows oâ\\x80\\x99ercast,\\nSit joyless on the ground and fast.\\nTheir lovely chaplets dry and dead,\\nTheir courts unswept, with

limbs and dried,\\nAnd sitting on the lovely bank\\nHeld up the winecup as he drank.\\nNor did the grooms forget to feed\\nCamel and mule and ox and steed,\\nFor there were stores of roasted grain,\\nOf honey and of sugar-cane.\\nSo fast the wild excitement spread\\nAmong the warriors Bharat led,\\nThat all the mighty army through\\nThe groom no more his charger knew,\\nAnd he who drove might seek in vain\\nTo tell his elephant again.\\nWith every joy and rapture fired,\\nEntranced with all the heart desired,\\nThe myriads of the host that night\\nRevelled delirious with delight.\\nUrged by the damsels at their side\\nIn wild delight the warriors cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNeâ\\x80\\x99er will we seek AyodhyÃ¡, no,\\nNor yet to Daá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dak forest go:\\nHere will we

whateâ\\x80\\x99er the wish might crave.\\nAs each in new-wrought clothes arrayed\\nEnjoyed the feast before him laid.\\nEach man was seen in white attire\\nUnstained by spot or speck of mire:\\nNone was athirst or hungry there,\\nAnd none had dust upon his hair.\\nOn every side in woody dells\\nWas milky food in bubbling wells,\\nAnd there were all-supplying cows\\nAnd honey dropping from the

placed\\nDown by each riverâ\\x80\\x99s shelving side\\nThere stood great basins well supplied,\\nAnd laid therein, of dazzling sheen,\\nWhite brushes for the teeth were seen,\\nAnd many a covered box wherein\\nWas sandal powdered for the skin.\\nAnd mirrors bright with constant care,\\nAnd piles of new attire were there,\\nAnd store of sandals and of shoes,\\nThousands of pairs, for all to choose:\\nEye-unguents, combs for hair and beard,\\nUmbrellas fair and bows appeared.\\nLakes gleamed, that lent digestive aid,(368)\\nAnd some for pleasant bathing made,\\nWith waters fair, and

hermitâ\\x80\\x99s grove they spent\\nThat night in joy and merriment,\\nBlest as the Gods who take their ease\\nUnder the shade of Nandanâ\\x80\\x99s trees.\\nEach minstrel bade the saint adieu,\\nAnd to his blissful mansion flew,\\nAnd every stream and heavenly dame\\nReturned as swiftly as she came.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XCII. Bharatâ\\x80\\x99s Farewell.\\n\\n\\nSo Bharat with his army spent\\nThe watches of the night content,\\nAnd gladly, with the morningâ\\x80\\x99s light\\nDrew near his host the anchorite.\\nWhen BharadvÃ¡ja saw him stand\\nWith hand in reverence joined to hand,\\nWhen fires of worship had been fed,\\nHe looked upon the prince and said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO blameless son, I pray thee tell,\\nDid the past night content thee well?\\nSay if the feast my care supplied\\nThy host of followers gratified.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  His hands he joined, his head he bent\\nAnd spoke in answer reverent\\nTo the most high and radiant sage\\nWho issued from his hermitage:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell have I passed the night: thy feast\\nGave joy to every man and beast;\\nAnd I, great lord, and every peer\\nWere satisfied with sumptuous cheer,\\nThy banquet has delighted all\\nFrom highest chief to meanest thrall,\\nAnd rich attire and drink and meat\\nBanished the thought of toil and heat.\\nAnd now, O Hermit good and great,\\nA boon of thee I supplicate.\\nTo RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s side my steps I bend:\\nDo thou with friendly eye commend.\\nO tell me how to guide my feet\\nTo virtuous RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s lone retreat:\\nGreat Hermit, I entreat thee, say\\nHow far from here and which the way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus by fraternal love inspired\\nThe chieftain of the saint inquired:\\nThen thus replied the glorious seer\\nOf matchless might, of vows austere:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEre the fourth league from here be passed,\\nAmid a forest wild and vast,\\nStands ChitrakÃºá¹\\xadaâ\\x80\\x99s mountain tall,\\nLovely with wood and waterfall.\\nNorth of the mountain thou wilt see\\nThe beauteous stream MandÃ¡kinÃ\\xad,\\nWhere swarm the waterfowl below,\\nAnd gay trees on the margin grow.\\nThen will a leafy cot between\\nThe river and the hill be seen:\\nâ\\x80\\x99Tis RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s, and the princely pair\\nOf brothers live for certain there.\\nHence to the south thine army lead,\\nAnd then more southward still proceed,\\nSo shalt thou find his lone retreat,\\nAnd there the son of Raghu meet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Soon as the ordered march they knew,\\nThe widows of the monarch flew,\\nLeaving their cars, most meet to ride,\\nAnd flocked to BharadvÃ¡jaâ\\x80\\x99s side.\\nThere with the good SumitrÃ¡ Queen\\nKauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡, sad and worn, was seen,\\nCaressing, still with sorrow faint,\\nThe feet of that illustrious saint,\\nKaikeyÃ\\xad too, her longings crossed,\\nReproached of all, her object lost,\\nBefore the famous hermit came,\\nAnd clasped his feet, oâ\\x80\\x99erwhelmed with shame.\\nWith circling steps she humbly went\\nAround the saint preÃ«minent,\\nAnd stood not far from Bharatâ\\x80\\x99s side\\nWith heart oppressed, and heavy-eyed.\\nThen the great seer, who never broke\\nOne holy vow, to Bharat spoke:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak, Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son: I fain would learn\\nThe story of each queen in turn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Obedient to the high request\\nBy BharadvÃ¡ja thus addressed,\\nHis reverent hands together laid,\\nHe, skilled in speech, his answer made:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe whom, O Saint, thou seest here\\nA Goddess in her form appear,\\nWas the chief consort of the king,\\nNow worn with fast and sorrowing.\\nAs Aditi in days of yore\\nThe all-preserving Vishá¹\\x87u bore,\\nKauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡ bore with happy fate\\nLord RÃ¡ma of the lionâ\\x80\\x99s gait.\\nShe who, transfixed with torturing pangs,\\nOn her left arm so fondly hangs,\\nAs when her withering leaves decay\\nDroops by the wood the Cassia spray,\\nSumitrÃ¡, pained with woe, is she,\\nThe consort second of the three:\\nTwo princely sons the lady bare,\\nFair as the Gods in heaven are fair.\\nAnd she, the wicked dame through whom\\nMy brothersâ\\x80\\x99 lives are wrapped in gloom,\\nAnd mourning for his offspring dear,\\nThe king has sought his heavenly sphere,â\\x80\\x94\\nProud, foolish-hearted, swift to ire,\\nSelf-fancied darling of my sire,\\nKaikeyÃ\\xad, most ambitious queen,\\nUnlovely with her lovely mien,\\nMy mother she, whose impious will\\nIs ever bent on deeds of ill,\\nIn whom the root and spring I see\\nOf all this woe which crushes me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Quick breathing like a furious snake,\\nWith tears and sobs the hero spake,\\nWith reddened eyes aglow with rage.\\nAnd BharadvÃ¡ja, mighty sage,\\nSupreme in wisdom, calm and grave,\\nIn words like these good counsel gave:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO Bharat, hear the words I say;\\nOn her the fault thou must not lay:\\nFor many a blessing yet will spring\\nFrom banished RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s wandering.â\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd Bharat, with that promise cheered,\\nWent circling round that saint revered,\\nHe humbly bade farewell, and then\\nGave orders to collect his men.\\nPrompt at the summons thousands flew\\nTo cars which noble coursers drew,\\nBright-gleaming, glorious to behold,\\nAdorned with wealth of burnished gold.\\nThen female elephants and male,\\nGold-girthed, with flags that wooed the gale,\\nMarched with their bright bellsâ\\x80\\x99 tinkling chime\\nLike clouds when ends the summer time:\\nSome cars were huge and some were light,\\nFor heavy draught or rapid flight,\\nOf costly price, of every kind,\\nWith clouds of infantry behind.\\nThe dames, KauÅ\\x9balyÃ¡ at their head,\\nWere in the noblest chariots led,\\nAnd every gentle bosom beat\\nWith hope the banished prince to meet.\\nThe royal Bharat, glory-crowned,\\nWith all his retinue around,\\nBorne in a beauteous litter rode,\\nLike the young moon and sun

live!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then, when the solemn rite was oâ\\x80\\x99er,\\nCame RÃ¡ma to the river shore,\\nAnd offered, with his brothersâ\\x80\\x99 aid,\\nFresh tribute to his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s

path that brought him to the place,\\nAnd up the mountainâ\\x80\\x99s pleasant side\\nWhere lovely lawns lay fair, he hied.\\nSoon as his cottage door he gained\\nHis brothers to his breast he strained.\\nFrom them and SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ in their woes\\nSo loud the cry of weeping rose,\\nThat like the roar of lions round\\nThe mountain rolled the echoing sound.\\nAnd Bharatâ\\x80\\x99s army shook

cloud.\\nThen, with their consorts gathered near,\\nWild elephants in sudden fear\\nRushed to a distant wood, and shed\\nAn odour round them as they fled.\\nAnd every silvan thing that dwelt\\nWithin those shades the terror felt,\\nDeer, lion, tiger, boar and roe,\\nBison, wild-cow, and buffalo.\\nAnd when the tumult wild they heard,\\nWith trembling pinions flew each bird,\\nFrom tree, from

flame.\\nBefore the ancient sage they bent,\\nAnd clasped his feet most reverent;\\nThen at his invitation found\\nA seat beside him on the ground.\\nThen RÃ¡ma prayed the sage would deign\\nLord Indraâ\\x80\\x99s visit to explain;\\nAnd thus at length the holy man\\nIn answer to his prayer began:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cThis Lord of boons has sought me here\\nTo waft me hence to BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s sphere,\\nWon by my penance long and stern,â\\x80\\x94\\nA home the lawless neâ\\x80\\x99er can earn.\\nBut when I knew that thou wast nigh,\\nTo BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s world I could not fly\\nUntil

SÃ\\xadtÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s Speech.\\n\\n\\nBlest by the sage, when Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son\\nHis onward journey had begun,\\nThus in her soft tone SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, meek\\nWith modest fear, began to speak:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne little slip the great may lead\\nTo shame that follows lawless deed:\\nSuch shame, my lord, as still must cling\\nTo faults from low desire that spring.\\nThree several sins defile the soul,\\nBorn of desire that spurns control:\\nFirst, utterance of a lying word,\\nThen, viler both, the next, and third:\\nThe lawless love of otherâ\\x80\\x99s wife,\\nThe thirst of blood uncaused by strife.\\nThe first, O Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, in thee\\nNone yet has found, none eâ\\x80\\x99er shall see.\\nLove of anotherâ\\x80\\x99s dame destroys\\nAll merit, lost for guilty joys:\\nRÃ¡ma, such crime in thee, I ween,\\nHas neâ\\x80\\x99er been found, shall neâ\\x80\\x99er be seen:\\nThe very thought, my princely lord,\\nIs in thy secret soul abhorred.\\nFor thou hast ever been the same\\nFond lover of thine own dear dame,\\nContent with faithful heart to do\\nThy fatherâ\\x80\\x99s will, most just and true:\\nJustice, and faith, and many a grace\\nIn thee have found a resting-place.\\nSuch virtues, Prince, the good may gain\\nWho empire oâ\\x80\\x99er each sense retain;\\nAnd well canst thou, with loving view\\nRegarding all, each sense subdue.\\nBut for the third, the lust that strives,\\nInsatiate still, for othersâ\\x80\\x99 lives,â\\x80\\x94\\nFond thirst of blood where hate is none,â\\x80\\x94\\nThis, O my lord, thou wilt not shun.\\nThou hast but now a promise made,\\nThe saints of Daá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dak wood to aid:\\nAnd to protect their lives from ill\\nThe giantsâ\\x80\\x99 blood in tight wilt spill:\\nAnd from thy promise lasting fame\\nWill glorify the forestâ\\x80\\x99s name.\\nArmed with thy bow and arrows thou\\nForth with thy brother journeyest now,\\nWhile as I think how true thou art\\nFears for thy bliss assail my heart,\\nAnd all my spirit at the sight\\nIs troubled with a strange affright.\\nI like it notâ\\x80\\x94it seems not goodâ\\x80\\x94\\nThy going thus to Daá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dak wood:\\nAnd I, if thou wilt mark me well,\\nThe reason of my fear will tell.\\nThou with thy brother, bow in hand,\\nBeneath those ancient trees wilt stand,\\nAnd thy keen arrows will not spare\\nWood-rovers who will meet thee there.\\nFor as the fuel food supplies\\nThat bids the dormant flame arise,\\nThus when the warrior grasps his bow\\nHe feels his breast with ardour glow.\\nDeep in a holy grove, of yore,\\nWhere bird and beast from strife forbore,\\nÅ\\x9auchi beneath the sheltering boughs,\\nA truthful hermit kept his vows.\\nThen Indra, Å\\x9aachÃ\\xadâ\\x80\\x99s heavenly lord,\\nArmed like a warrior with a sword,\\nCame to his tranquil home to spoil\\nThe hermit of his holy toil,\\nAnd left the glorious weapon there\\nEntrusted to the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s care,\\nA pledge for him to keep, whose mind\\nTo fervent zeal was all resigned.\\nHe took the brand: with utmost heed\\nHe kept it for the warriorâ\\x80\\x99s need:\\nTo keep his trust he fondly strove\\nWhen roaming in the neighbouring grove:\\nWheneâ\\x80\\x99er for roots and fruit he strayed\\nStill by his side he bore the blade:\\nStill on his sacred charge intent,\\nHe took his treasure when he went.\\nAs day by day that brand he wore,\\nThe hermit, rich in meritâ\\x80\\x99s store\\nFrom penance rites each thought withdrew,\\nAnd fierce and wild his spirit grew.\\nWith heedless soul he spurned the right,\\nAnd found in cruel deeds delight.\\nSo, living with the sword, he fell,\\nA ruined hermit, down to hell.\\nThis tale applies to those who deal\\nToo closely with the warriorâ\\x80\\x99s steel:\\nThe steel to warriors is the same\\nAs fuel to the smouldering flame.\\nSincere affection prompts my speech:\\nI honour where I fain would teach.\\nMayst thou, thus armed with shaft and bow,\\nSo dire a longing never know\\nAs, when no hatred prompts the fray,\\nThese giants of the wood to slay:\\nFor he who kills without offence\\nShall win but little glory thence.\\nThe bow the warrior joys to bend\\nIs lent him for a nobler end,\\nThat he may save and succour those\\nWho watch in woods when pressed by foes.\\nWhat, matched with woods, is bow or steel?\\nWhat, warriorâ\\x80\\x99s arm with hermitâ\\x80\\x99s zeal?\\nWe with such might have naught to do:\\nThe forest rule should guide us too.\\nBut when AyodhyÃ¡ hails thee lord,\\nBe then thy warrior life restored:\\nSo shall thy sire(423) and mother joy\\nIn bliss that naught may eâ\\x80\\x99er destroy.\\nAnd if, resigning empire, thou\\nSubmit thee to the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s vow,\\nThe noblest gain from virtue springs,\\nAnd virtue joy unending brings.\\nAll earthly blessings virtue sends:\\nOn virtue all the world depends.\\nThose who with vow and fasting tame\\nTo due restraint the mind and frame,\\nWin by their labour, nobly wise,\\nThe highest virtue for their prize.\\nPure in the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s grove remain,\\nTrue to thy duty, free from stain.\\nBut the three worlds are open thrown\\nTo thee, by whom all things are known.\\nWho gave me power that I should dare\\nHis duty to my lord declare?\\nâ\\x80\\x99Tis womanâ\\x80\\x99s fancy, light as air,\\n  That moves my foolish breast.\\nNow with thy brother

loveliest nymphs, as fair\\nAs lightning in the evening air,\\nArmed with their winning wiles, seduce\\nFrom his stern vows the great recluse.\\nThough lore of earth and heaven he knew,\\nThe hermit from his task they drew,\\nAnd made the great ascetic slave\\nTo conquering love, the Gods to save.\\nEach of the heavenly five became,\\nBound to the sage, his wedded dame;\\nAnd he, for his belovedâ\\x80\\x99s sake,\\nFormed a fair palace neath the lake.\\nUnder the flood the ladies live,\\nTo joy and ease their days they give,\\nAnd lap in bliss the hermit wooed\\nFrom penance rites to youth renewed.\\nSo when the sportive nymphs within\\nThose secret bowers their play begin,\\nYou hear the singersâ\\x80\\x99 dulcet tones\\nBlend sweetly with their tinkling zones.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cHow wondrous are these words of thine!â\\x80\\x9d\\nCried the famed chiefs of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s line,\\nAs thus they heard the sage unfold\\nThe marvels of the tale he told.\\n\\n  As RÃ¡ma spake, his eyes were bent\\nUpon a hermit settlement\\nWith light of heavenly lore endued,\\nWith sacred grass and vesture strewed.\\nHis wife and brother by his side,\\nWithin the holy bounds he hied,\\nAnd there, with honour entertained\\nBy all the saints, a while remained.\\nIn time, by due succession led,\\nEach votaryâ\\x80\\x99s cot he visited,\\nAnd then the lord of martial lore,\\nReturned where he had lodged before.\\nHere for the months, content, he stayed,\\nThere for a year his visit paid:\\nHere for four months his home would fix,\\nThere, as it chanced, for five or six.\\nHere for eight months and there for three\\nThe son of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s stay would be:\\nHere weeks, there fortnights, more or less,\\nHe spent in tranquil happiness.\\nAs there the hero dwelt at ease\\nAmong those holy devotees,\\nIn days untroubled oâ\\x80\\x99er his head\\nTen circling years of pleasure fled.\\nSo Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son in duty trained\\nA while in every cot remained,\\nThen with his dame retraced the road\\nTo good SutÃ\\xadkshá¹\\x87aâ\\x80\\x99s calm abode.\\nHailed by the saints with honours due\\nNear to the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s home he drew,\\nAnd there the tamer of his foes\\nDwelt for a time in sweet repose.\\nOne day within that holy wood\\nBy saint SutÃ\\xadkshá¹\\x87a RÃ¡ma stood,\\nAnd thus the prince with reverence meek\\nTo that high sage began to speak:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cIn the wide woodlands that extend\\nAround us, lord most reverend,\\nAs frequent voice of rumour tells,\\nAgastya, saintliest hermit, dwells.\\nSo vast the wood, I cannot trace\\nThe path to reach his dwelling place,\\nNor, searching unassisted, find\\nThat hermit of the thoughtful mind.\\nI with my wife and brother fain\\nWould go, his favour to obtain,\\nWould seek him in his lone retreat\\nAnd the great saint with reverence greet.\\nThis one desire, O Master, long\\nCherished within my heart, is strong,\\nThat I may pay of free accord\\nMy duty to that hermit lord.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  As thus the prince whose heart was bent\\nOn virtue told his firm intent,\\nThe good SutÃ\\xadkshá¹\\x87aâ\\x80\\x99s joy rose high,\\nAnd thus in turn he made reply:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe very thing, O Prince, which thou\\nHast sought, I wished to urge but now,\\nBid thee with wife and brother see\\nAgastya, glorious devotee.\\nI count this thing an omen fair\\nThat thou shouldst thus thy wish declare,\\nAnd I, my Prince, will gladly teach\\nThe way Agastyaâ\\x80\\x99s home to reach.\\nSouthward, dear son, direct thy feet\\nEight leagues beyond this still retreat:\\nAgastyaâ\\x80\\x99s hermit brother there\\nDwells in a home most bright and fair.\\nâ\\x80\\x99Tis on a knoll of woody ground,\\nWith many a branching Pippal(426) crowned:\\nThere sweet birdsâ\\x80\\x99 voices neâ\\x80\\x99er are mute,\\nAnd trees are gay with flower and fruit.\\nThere many a lake gleams bright and cool,\\nAnd lilies deck each pleasant pool,\\nWhile swan, and crane, and mallardâ\\x80\\x99s wings\\nAre lovely in the water-springs.\\nThere for one night, O RÃ¡ma, stay,\\nAnd with the dawn pursue thy way.\\nStill farther, bending southward, by\\nThe thicketâ\\x80\\x99s edge the course must lie,\\nAnd thou wilt see, two leagues from thence\\nAgastyaâ\\x80\\x99s lovely residence,\\nSet in the woodlandâ\\x80\\x99s fairest spot,\\nAll varied foliage decks the cot:\\nThere SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, Lakshmaá¹\\x87 thou, at ease\\nMay spend sweet hours neath shady trees,\\nFor all of noblest growth are found\\nLuxuriant on that bosky ground.\\nIf it be still thy firm intent\\nTo see that saint preÃ«minent,\\nO mighty counsellor, this day\\nDepart upon thine onward way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The hermit spake, and RÃ¡ma bent\\nHis head, with Lakshmaá¹\\x87, reverent,\\nAnd then with him and Janakâ\\x80\\x99s child\\nSet out to trace the forest wild.\\nHe saw dark woods that fringed the road,\\nAnd distant hills like clouds that showed,\\nAnd, as the way he followed, met\\nWith many a lake and rivulet.\\nSo passing on with ease where led\\nThe path SutÃ\\xadkshá¹\\x87a bade him tread,\\nThe hero with exulting breast\\nHis brother in these words addressed:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cHere, surely, is the home, in sight,\\nOf that illustrious anchorite:\\nHere great Agastyaâ\\x80\\x99s brother leads\\nA life intent on holy deeds.\\nWarned of each guiding mark and sign,\\nI see them all herein combine:\\nI see the branches bending low\\nBeneath the flowers and fruit they show.\\nA soft air from the forest springs,\\nFresh from the odorous grass, and brings\\nA spicy fragrance as it flees\\nOâ\\x80\\x99er the ripe fruit of Pippal trees.\\nSee, here and there around us high\\nPiled up in heaps cleft billets lie,\\nAnd holy grass is gathered, bright\\nAs strips of shining lazulite.\\nFull in the centre of the shade\\nThe hermitsâ\\x80\\x99 holy fire is laid:\\nI see its smoke the pure heaven streak\\nDense as a big cloudâ\\x80\\x99s dusky peak.\\nThe twice-born men their steps retrace\\nFrom each sequestered bathing-place,\\nAnd each his sacred gift has brought\\nOf blossoms which his hands have sought.\\nOf all these signs, dear brother, each\\nAgrees with good SutÃ\\xadkshá¹\\x87aâ\\x80\\x99s speech,\\nAnd doubtless in this holy bound\\nAgastyaâ\\x80\\x99s brother will be found.\\nAgastya once, the worlds who viewed\\nWith love, a Deathlike fiend subdued,\\nAnd armed with mighty power, obtained\\nBy holy works, this grove ordained\\nTo be a refuge and defence\\nFrom all oppressorsâ\\x80\\x99 violence.\\nIn days of yore within this place\\nTwo brothers fierce of demon race,\\nVÃ¡tÃ¡pi dire and Ilval, dwelt,\\nAnd slaughter mid the BrÃ¡hmans dealt.\\nA BrÃ¡hmanâ\\x80\\x99s form, the fiend to cloak,\\nFierce Ilval wore, and Sanskrit spoke,\\nAnd twice-born sages would invite\\nTo solemnize some funeral rite.\\nHis brotherâ\\x80\\x99s flesh, concealed within\\nA ramâ\\x80\\x99s false shape and borrowed skin,â\\x80\\x94\\nAs men are wont at funeral feasts,â\\x80\\x94\\nHe dressed and fed those gathered priests.\\nThe holy men, unweeting ill,\\nTook of the food and ate their fill.\\nThen Ilval with a mighty shout\\nExclaimed â\\x80\\x9cVÃ¡tÃ¡pi, issue out.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSoon as his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s voice he heard,\\nThe fiend with ram-like bleating stirred:\\nRending in pieces every frame,\\nForth from the dying priests he came.\\nSo they who changed their forms at will\\nThousands of BrÃ¡hmans dared to kill,â\\x80\\x94\\nFierce fiends who loved each cruel deed,\\nAnd joyed on bleeding flesh to feed.\\nAgastya, mighty hermit, pressed\\nTo funeral banquet like the rest,\\nObedient to the Godsâ\\x80\\x99 appeal\\nAte up the monster at a meal.\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis done, â\\x80\\x99tis done,â\\x80\\x9d fierce Ilval cried,\\nAnd water for his hands supplied:\\nThen lifting up his voice he spake:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cForth, brother, from thy prison break.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen him who called the fiend, who long\\nHad wrought the suffering BrÃ¡hmans wrong,\\nThus thoughtful-souled Agastya, best\\nOf hermits, with a smile addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow, RÃ¡kshas, is the fiend empowered\\nTo issue forth whom I devoured?\\nThy brother in a ramâ\\x80\\x99s disguise\\nIs gone where YÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s kingdom lies.â\\x80\\x9d\\nWhen from the words Agastya said\\nHe knew his brother fiend was dead,\\nHis soul on fire with vengeful rage,\\nRushed the night-rover at the sage.\\nOne lightning glance of fury, hot\\nAs fire, the glorious hermit shot,\\nAs the fiend neared him in his stride,\\nAnd straight, consumed to dust, he died.\\nIn pity for the BrÃ¡hmansâ\\x80\\x99 plight\\nAgastya wrought this deed of might:\\nThis grove which lakes and fair trees grace\\nIn his great brotherâ\\x80\\x99s dwelling place.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  As RÃ¡ma thus the tale rehearsed,\\nAnd with SumitrÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s son conversed,\\nThe setting sun his last rays shed,\\nAnd evening oâ\\x80\\x99er the land was spread.\\nA while the princely brothers stayed\\nAnd even rites in order paid,\\nThen to the holy grove they drew\\nAnd hailed the saint with honour due.\\nWith courtesy was RÃ¡ma met\\nBy that illustrious anchoret,\\nAnd for one night he rested there\\nRegaled with fruit and hermit fare.\\nBut when the night had reached its close,\\nAnd the sunâ\\x80\\x99s glorious circle rose,\\nThe son of Raghu left his bed\\nAnd to the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s brother said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell rested in thy hermit cell,\\nI stand, O saint, to bid farewell;\\nFor with thy leave I journey hence\\nThy brother saint to reverence.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo, RÃ¡ma go,â\\x80\\x9d the sage replied:\\nThen from the cot the chieftain hied.\\nAnd while the pleasant grove he viewed,\\nThe path the hermit showed, pursued.\\nOf every leaf, of changing hue.\\nPlants, trees by hundreds round him grew,\\nWith joyous eyes he looked on all,\\nThen Jak,(427) the wild rice, and SÃ¡l;(428)\\nHe saw the red Hibiscus glow,\\nHe saw the flower-tipped creeper throw\\nThe glory of her clusters oâ\\x80\\x99er\\nTall trees that loads of blossom bore.\\nSome, elephants had prostrate laid,\\nIn some the monkeys leapt and played,\\nAnd through the whole wide forest rang\\nThe charm of gay birds as they sang.\\nThen RÃ¡ma of the lotus eye\\nTo Lakshmaá¹\\x87 turned who followed nigh,\\nAnd thus the hero youth impressed\\nWith Fortuneâ\\x80\\x99s favouring signs, addressed:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cHow soft the leaves of every tree,\\nHow tame each bird and beast we see!\\nSoon the fair home shall we behold\\nOf that great hermit tranquil-souled.\\nThe deed the good Agastya wrought\\nHigh fame throughout the world has

gentle, throng,\\nAnd every bird is loud in song.\\nWith ruth for suffering creatures filled,\\nA deathlike fiend with might he killed,\\nAnd gave this southern realm to be\\nA refuge, from oppression free.\\nThere stands his home, whose dreaded might\\nHas put the giant crew to flight,\\nWho view with envious eyes afar\\nThe peaceful shades they cannot mar.\\nSince that most holy saint has

The Battle.\\n\\n\\nWhen Khara with the hosts he led\\nDrew near to RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s leafy shed,\\nHe saw that queller of the foe\\nStand ready with his ordered bow.\\nHe saw, and burning at the view\\nHis clanging bow he raised and drew,\\nAnd bade his driver urge apace\\nHis car to meet him face to face.\\nObedient to his masterâ\\x80\\x99s hest\\nHis eager steeds the driver pressed\\nOn to the spot where, none to aid,\\nThe strong-armed chief his weapon swayed.\\nSoon as the children of the night\\nSaw Khara rushing to the fight,\\nHis lords with loud unearthly cry\\nFollowed their chief and gathered nigh.\\nAs in his car the leader rode\\nWith all his lords around, he showed\\nLike the red planet fiery Mars\\nSurrounded by the lesser stars.\\nThen with a horrid yell that rent\\nThe air, the giant chieftain sent\\nA thousand darts in rapid shower\\nOn RÃ¡ma matchless in his power.\\nThe rovers of the night, impelled\\nBy fiery rage which naught withheld,\\nUpon the unconquered prince, who strained\\nHis fearful bow, their arrows rained.\\nWith sword and club, with mace and pike,\\nWith spear and axe to pierce and strike,\\nThose furious fiends on every side\\nThe unconquerable hero plied.\\nThe giant legions huge and strong,\\nLike clouds the tempest drives along,\\nRushed upon RÃ¡ma with the speed\\nOf whirling car, and mounted steed,\\nAnd hill-like elephant, to slay\\nThe matchless prince in battle fray.\\nThen upon RÃ¡ma thick and fast\\nThe rain of mortal steel they cast,\\nAs labouring clouds their torrents shed\\nUpon the mountain-monarchâ\\x80\\x99s(467) head.\\nAs near and nearer round him drew\\nThe warriors of the giant crew,\\nHe showed like Å\\x9aiva girt by all\\nHis spirits when nightâ\\x80\\x99s shadows fall.\\nAs the great deep receives each rill\\nAnd river rushing from the hill,\\nHe bore that flood of darts, and broke\\nWith well-aimed shaft each murderous stroke.\\nBy stress of arrowy storm assailed,\\nAnd wounded sore, he never failed,\\nLike some high mountain which defies\\nThe red bolts flashing from the skies.\\nWith ruddy streams each limb was dyed\\nFrom gaping wounds in breast and side,\\nShowing the hero like the sun\\nâ\\x80\\x99Mid crimson clouds ere day is done.\\nThen, at that sight of terror, faint\\nGrew God, Gandharva, sage, and saint,\\nTrembling to see the prince oppose\\nHis single might to myriad foes.\\nBut waxing wroth, with force unspent,\\nHe strained his bow to utmost bent,\\nAnd forth his arrows keen and true\\nIn hundreds, yea in thousands flew,â\\x80\\x94\\nShafts none could ward, and none endure:\\nDeathâ\\x80\\x99s fatal noose was scarce so sure.\\nAs â\\x80\\x99twere in playful ease he shot\\nHis gilded shafts, and rested not.\\nWith swiftest flight and truest aim\\nUpon the giant hosts they came.\\nEach smote, each stayed a foemanâ\\x80\\x99s breath\\nAs fatal as the coil of Death.\\nEach arrow through a giant tore\\nA passage, and besmeared with gore,\\nPursued its onward way and through\\nThe air with flamy brilliance flew.\\nUnnumbered were the arrows sent\\nFrom the great bow which RÃ¡ma bent,\\nAnd every shaft with iron head\\nThe lifeblood of a giant shed.\\nTheir pennoned bows were cleft, nor mail\\nNor shield of hide could aught avail.\\nFor RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s myriad arrows tore\\nThrough arms, and bracelets which they wore,\\nAnd severed mighty warriorsâ\\x80\\x99 thighs\\nLike trunks of elephants in size,\\nAnd cut resistless passage sheer\\nThrough gold-decked horse and charioteer,\\nSlew elephant and rider, slew\\nThe horseman and the charger too,\\nAnd infantry unnumbered sent\\nTo dwell â\\x80\\x99neath YÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s government.\\nThen rose on high a fearful yell\\nOf rovers of the night, who fell\\nBeneath that iron torrent, sore\\nWounded by shafts that rent and tore.\\nSo mangled by the ceaseless storm\\nOf shafts of every kind and form,\\nSuch joy they found, as forests feel\\nWhen scorched by flame, from RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s steel.\\nThe mightiest still the fight maintained,\\nAnd furious upon RÃ¡ma rained\\nDart, arrow, spear, with wild attacks\\nOf mace, and club, and battle-axe.\\nBut the great chief, unconquered yet,\\nTheir weapons with his arrows met,\\nWhich severed many a giantâ\\x80\\x99s head,\\nAnd all the plain with corpses spread.\\nWith sundered bow and shattered shield\\nHeadless they sank upon the field,\\nAs the tall trees, that felt the blast\\nOf Garuá¸\\x8dâ\\x80\\x99s wing, to earth were cast.\\nThe giants left unslaughtered there\\nWhere filled with terror and despair,\\nAnd to their leader Khara fled\\nFaint, wounded, and discomfited.\\nThese fiery DÃºshaá¹\\x87 strove to cheer,\\nAnd poised his bow to calm their fear;\\nThen fierce as He who rules the dead,\\nWhen wroth, on angered RÃ¡ma sped.\\nBy DÃºshaá¹\\x87 cheered, the demons cast\\nTheir dread aside and rallied fast\\nWith SÃ¡ls, rocks, palm-trees in their hands\\nWith nooses, maces, pikes, and brands,\\nAgain upon the godlike man\\nThe mighty fiends infuriate ran,\\nThese casting rocks like hail, and these\\nA whelming shower of leafy trees.\\nWild, wondrous fight, the eye to scare,\\nAnd raise on end each shuddering hair,\\nAs with the fiends who loved to rove\\nBy night heroic RÃ¡ma strove!\\nThe giants in their fury plied\\nRÃ¡ma with darts on every side.\\nThen, by the gathering demons pressed\\nFrom north and south and east and west,\\nBy showers of deadly darts assailed\\nFrom every quarter fiercely hailed,\\nGirt by the foes who swarmed around,\\nHe raised a mighty shout whose sound\\nStruck terror. On the giant crew\\nHis great Gandharva(468) arrow flew.\\nA thousand mortal shafts were rained\\nFrom the orbed bow the hero strained,\\nTill east and west and south and north\\nWere filled with arrows volleyed forth.\\nThey heard the fearful shout: they saw\\nHis mighty hand the bowstring draw,\\nYet could no wounded giantâ\\x80\\x99s eye\\nSee the swift storm of arrows fly.\\nStill firm the warrior stood and cast\\nHis deadly missiles thick and fast.\\nDark grew the air with arrowy hail\\nWhich hid the sun as with a veil.\\nFiends wounded, falling, fallen, slain,\\nAll in a moment, spread the plain,\\nAnd thousands scarce alive were left\\nMangled, and gashed, and torn, and cleft.\\nDire was the sight, the plain oâ\\x80\\x99erspread\\nWith trophies of the mangled dead.\\nThere lay, by RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s missiles rent,\\nFull many a priceless ornament,\\nWith severed limb and broken gem,\\nHauberk and helm and diadem.\\nThere lay the shattered car, the steed,\\nThe elephant of noblest breed,\\nThe splintered spear, the shivered mace,\\nChouris and screens to shade the face.\\nThe giants saw with bitterest pain\\nTheir warriors weltering on the plain,\\nNor dared again his might oppose\\nWho scourged the cities of his foes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XXVI.

nobly done!\\nWell hast thou fought, Kakutsthaâ\\x80\\x99s son!â\\x80\\x9d\\nBut the great three, the host who led,\\nEnraged to see their chieftain dead,\\nAs though Deathâ\\x80\\x99s toils were round them cast,\\nRushed upon RÃ¡ma fierce and fast,\\nMahÃ¡kapÃ¡la seized, to strike\\nHis foeman down, a ponderous pike:\\nSthÃºlÃ¡ksha charged with spear to fling,\\nPramÃ¡thi with his axe to swing.\\nWhen RÃ¡ma saw, with keen darts he\\nReceived the onset of the three,\\nAs calm as though he hailed a guest\\nIn each, who came for shade and rest.\\nMahÃ¡kapÃ¡laâ\\x80\\x99s monstrous head\\nFell with the trenchant dart he sped.\\nHis good right hand in battle skilled\\nSthÃºlÃ¡kshaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes with arrows filled,\\nAnd trusting still his ready bow\\nHe laid the fierce PramÃ¡thi low,\\nWho sank as some tall tree falls down\\nWith bough and branch and leafy crown.\\nThen with five thousand shafts he slew\\nThe rest of DÃºshaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s giant crew:\\nFive thousand demons, torn and rent,\\nTo YÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s gloomy realm he sent.\\n\\n  When Khara knew the fate of all\\nThe giant band and DÃºshaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s fall,\\nHe called the mighty chiefs who led\\nHis army, and in fury said:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cNow DÃºshaá¹\\x87 and his armÃ¨d train\\nLie prostrate on the battle plain.\\nLead forth an army mightier still,\\nRÃ¡ma this wretched man, to kill.\\nFight ye with darts of every shape,\\nNor let him from your wrath escape.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus spoke the fiend, by rage impelled,\\nAnd straight his course toward RÃ¡ma held.\\nWith Å\\x9ayenagÃ¡mÃ\\xad and the rest\\nOf his twelve chiefs he onward pressed,\\nAnd every giant as he went\\nA storm of well-wrought arrows sent.\\nThen with his pointed shafts that came\\nWith gold and diamond bright as flame,\\nDead to the earth the hero threw\\nThe remnant of the demon crew.\\nThose shafts with feathers bright as gold,\\nLike flames which wreaths of smoke enfold,\\nSmote down the fiends like tall trees rent\\nBy red bolts from the firmament.\\nA hundred shafts he pointed well:\\nBy their keen barbs a hundred fell:\\nA thousand,â\\x80\\x94and a thousand more\\nIn battleâ\\x80\\x99s front lay drenched in gore.\\nOf all defence and guard bereft,\\nWith sundered bows and harness cleft.\\nTheir bodies red with bloody stain\\nFell the night-rovers on the plain,\\nWhich, covered with the loosened hair\\nOf bleeding giants prostrate there,\\nLike some great altar showed, arrayed\\nFor holy rites with grass oâ\\x80\\x99erlaid.\\nThe darksome wood, each glade and dell\\nWhere the wild demons fought and fell\\nWas like an awful hell whose floor\\nIs thick with mire and flesh and gore.\\n\\n  Thus twice seven thousand fiends, a band\\nWith impious heart and bloody hand,\\nBy Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son were overthrown,\\nA man, on foot, and all alone.\\nOf all who met on that fierce day,\\nKhara, great chief, survived the fray,\\nThe monster of the triple head,(470)\\nAnd Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, the foemanâ\\x80\\x99s dread.\\nThe other demon warriors, all\\nSkilful and brave and strong and tall,\\nIn front of battle, side by side,\\nStruck down by Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s brother died.\\n  When Khara saw the host he led\\n    Triumphant forth to fight\\n  Stretched on the earth, all smitten dead,\\n    By RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s nobler might,\\n  Upon his foe he fiercely glared,\\n    And drove against him fast,\\n  Like Indra when his arm is bared\\n    His thundering bolt to cast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XXVII. The Death Of TrisirÃ¡s.\\n\\n\\nBut TriÅ\\x9birÃ¡s,(471) a chieftain dread,\\nMarked Khara as he onward sped.\\nAnd met his car and cried, to stay\\nThe giant from the purposed fray:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMine be the charge: let me attack,\\nAnd turn thee from the contest back.\\nLet me go forth, and thou shalt see\\nThe strong-armed RÃ¡ma slain by me.\\nTrue are the words I speak, my lord:\\nI swear it as I touch my sword:\\nThat I this RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s blood will spill,\\nWhom every giantâ\\x80\\x99s hand should kill.\\nThis RÃ¡ma will I slay, or he\\nIn battle fray shall conquer me.\\nRestrain thy spirit: check thy car,\\nAnd view the combat from afar.\\nThou, joying oâ\\x80\\x99er the prostrate foe,\\nTo JanasthÃ¡n again shalt go,\\nOr, if I fall in battleâ\\x80\\x99s chance,\\nAgainst my conqueror advance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus TriÅ\\x9birÃ¡s for death who yearned:\\nAnd Khara from the conflict turned,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo forth to battle,â\\x80\\x9d Khara cried;\\nAnd toward his foe the giant hied.\\nBorne on a car of glittering hue\\nWhich harnessed coursers fleetly drew,\\nLike some huge hill with triple peak\\nHe onward rushed the prince to seek.\\nStill, like a big cloud, sending out\\nHis arrowy rain with many a shout\\nLike the deep sullen roars that come\\nDiscordant from a moistened drum.\\nBut Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, whose watchful eye\\nBeheld the demon rushing nigh,\\nFrom the great bow he raised and bent\\nA shower of shafts to meet him sent.\\nWild grew the fight and wilder yet\\nAs fiend and man in combat met,\\nAs when in some dark woodâ\\x80\\x99s retreat\\nAn elephant and a lion meet.\\n\\n  The giant bent his bow, and true\\nTo RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s brow three arrows flew.\\nThen, raging as he felt the stroke,\\nThese words in anger RÃ¡ma spoke:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeroic chief! is such the power\\nOf fiends who rove at midnight hour?\\nSoft as the touch of flowers I feel\\nThe gentle blows thine arrows deal.\\nReceive in turn my shafts, and know\\nWhat arrows fly from RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s bow.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThus as he spoke his wrath grew hot,\\nAnd twice seven deadly shafts he shot,\\nWhich, dire as serpentâ\\x80\\x99s deadly fang,\\nStraight to the giantâ\\x80\\x99s bosom sprang.\\nFour arrows more,â\\x80\\x94each shaped to deal\\nA mortal wound with barbÃ¨d steel,â\\x80\\x94\\nThe glorious hero shot, and slew\\nThe four good steeds the car that drew.\\nEight other shafts flew straight and fleet,\\nAnd hurled the driver from his seat,\\nAnd in the dust the banner laid\\nThat proudly oâ\\x80\\x99er the chariot played.\\nThen as the fiend prepared to bound\\nForth from his useless car to ground,\\nThe hero smote him to the heart,\\nAnd numbed his arm with deadly smart.\\nAgain the chieftain, peerless-souled,\\nSent forth three rapid darts, and rolled\\nWith each keen arrow, deftly sped,\\nLow in the dust a monstrous head.\\nThen yielding to each deadly stroke,\\nForth spouting streams of blood and smoke,\\nThe headless trunk bedrenched with gore\\nFell to the ground and moved no more.\\nThe fiends who yet were left with life,\\nRouted and crushed in battle strife,\\nTo Kharaâ\\x80\\x99s side, like trembling deer\\nScared by the hunter, fled in fear.\\nKing Khara saw with furious eye\\nHis scattered giants turn and fly;\\nThen rallying his broken train\\nAt Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son he drove amain,\\nLike RÃ¡hu(472) when his deadly might\\nComes rushing on the Lord of Night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XXVIII. Khara Dismounted.\\n\\n\\nBut when he turned his eye where bled\\nBoth TriÅ\\x9birÃ¡s and DÃºshaá¹\\x87 dead,\\nFear oâ\\x80\\x99er the giantâ\\x80\\x99s spirit came\\nOf RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s might which naught could tame.\\nHe saw his savage legions, those\\nWhose force no creature dared oppose,â\\x80\\x94\\nHe saw the leader of his train\\nBy RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s single prowess slain.\\nWith burning grief he marked the few\\nStill left him of his giant crew.\\nAs Namuchi(473) on Indra, so\\nRushed the dread demon on his foe.\\nHis mighty bow the monster strained,\\nAnd angrily on RÃ¡ma rained\\nHis mortal arrows in a flood,\\nLike serpent fangs athirst for blood.\\nSkilled in the bowmanâ\\x80\\x99s warlike art,\\nHe plied the string and poised the dart.\\nHere, on his car, and there, he rode,\\nAnd passages of battle showed,\\nWhile all the skyey regions grew\\nDark with his arrows as they flew.\\nThen RÃ¡ma seized his ponderous bow,\\nAnd straight the heaven was all aglow\\nWith shafts whose stroke no life might bear\\nThat filled with flash and flame the air,\\nThick as the blinding torrents sent\\nDown from Parjanyaâ\\x80\\x99s(474) firmament.\\nIn space itself no space remained,\\nBut all was filled with arrows rained\\nIncessantly from each great bow\\nWielded by RÃ¡ma and his foe.\\nAs thus in furious combat, wrought\\nTo mortal hate, the warriors fought,\\nThe sun himself grew faint and pale,\\nObscured behind that arrowy veil.\\n\\n  As when beneath the driverâ\\x80\\x99s steel\\nAn elephant is forced to kneel,\\nSo from the hard and pointed head\\nOf many an arrow RÃ¡ma bled.\\nHigh on his car the giant rose\\nPrepared in deadly strife to close,\\nAnd all the spirits saw him stand\\nLike YÃ¡ma with his noose in hand.\\nFor Khara deemed in senseless pride\\nThat he, beneath whose hand had died\\nThe giant legions, failed at length\\nSlow sinking with exhausted strength.\\nBut RÃ¡ma, like a lion, when\\nA trembling deer comes nigh his den,\\nFeared not the demon mad with hate,â\\x80\\x94\\nOf lion might and lion gait.\\nThen in his lofty car that glowed\\nWith sunlike brilliance Khara rode\\nAt RÃ¡ma: madly on he came\\nLike a poor moth that seeks the flame.\\nHis archer skill the fiend displayed,\\nAnd at the place where RÃ¡ma laid\\nHis hand, an arrow cleft in two\\nThe mighty bow the hero drew.\\nSeven arrows by the giant sent,\\nBright as the bolts of Indra, rent\\nTheir way through mail and harness joints,\\nAnd pierced him with their iron points.\\nOn RÃ¡ma, hero unsurpassed,\\nA thousand shafts smote thick and fast,\\nWhile as each missile struck, rang out\\nThe giantâ\\x80\\x99s awful battle-shout.\\nHis knotted arrows pierced and tore\\nThe sunbright mail the hero wore,\\nTill, band and buckle rent away,\\nGlittering on the ground it lay.\\nThen pierced in shoulder, breast, and side,\\nTill every limb with blood was dyed,\\nThe chieftain in majestic ire\\nShone glorious as the smokeless fire.\\nThen loud and long the war-cry rose\\nOf RÃ¡ma, terror of his foes,\\nAs, on the giantâ\\x80\\x99s death intent,\\nA ponderous bow he strung and bent,â\\x80\\x94\\nLord Vishá¹\\x87uâ\\x80\\x99s own, of wondrous size,â\\x80\\x94\\nAgastya gave the heavenly prize.\\nThen rushing on the demon foe,\\nHe raised on high that mighty bow,\\nAnd with his well-wrought shafts, whereon\\nBright gold between the feathers shone,\\nHe struck the pennon fluttering oâ\\x80\\x99er\\nThe chariot, and it waved no more.\\nThat glorious flag whose every fold\\nWas rich with blazonry and gold,\\nFell as the sun himself by all\\nThe Godsâ\\x80\\x99 decree might earthward fall.\\nFrom wrathful Kharaâ\\x80\\x99s hand, whose art\\nWell knew each vulnerable part,\\nFour keenly-piercing arrows flew,\\nAnd blood in RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s bosom drew,\\nWith every limb distained with gore\\nFrom deadly shafts which rent and tore,\\nFrom Kharaâ\\x80\\x99s clanging bowstring shots,\\nThe princeâ\\x80\\x99s wrath waxed wondrous hot.\\nHis hand upon his bow that best\\nOf mighty archers firmly pressed,\\nAnd from the well-drawn bowstring, true\\nEach to its mark, six arrows flew.\\nOne quivered in the giantâ\\x80\\x99s head,\\nWith two his brawny shoulders bled;\\nThree, with the crescent heads they bore,\\nDeep in his breast a passage tore.\\nThirteen, to which the stone had lent\\nThe keenest point, were swiftly sent\\nOn the fierce giant, every one\\nDestructive, gleaming like the sun.\\nWith four the dappled steeds he slew;\\nOne cleft the chariot yoke in two,\\nOne, in the heat of battle sped,\\nSmote from the neck the driverâ\\x80\\x99s head.\\nThe poles were rent apart by three;\\nTwo broke the splintered axle-tree.\\nThen from the hand of RÃ¡ma, while\\nAcross his lips there came a smile,\\nThe twelfth, like thunderbolt impelled,\\nCut the great hand and bow it held.\\nThen, scarce by Indraâ\\x80\\x99s self surpassed,\\nHe pierced the giant with the last.\\nThe bow he trusted cleft in twain,\\nHis driver and his horses slain,\\nDown sprang the giant, mace in hand,\\nOn foot against the foe to stand.\\n  The Gods and saints in bright array\\n    Close gathered in the skies,\\n  The princeâ\\x80\\x99s might in battle-fray\\n    Beheld with joyful eyes.\\n  Uprising from their golden seats,\\n    Their hands in honour raised,\\n  They looked on RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s noble feats,\\n    And blessed him as they praised.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XXIX. Kharaâ\\x80\\x99s Defeat.\\n\\n\\nWhen RÃ¡ma saw the giant nigh,\\nOn foot, alone, with mace reared high,\\nIn mild reproof at first he spoke,\\nThen forth his threatening anger broke:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThou with the host â\\x80\\x99twas thine to lead,\\nWith elephant and car and steed,\\nHast wrought an act of sin and shame,\\nAn act which all who live must blame.\\nKnow that the wretch whose evil mind\\nJoys in the grief of human kind,\\nThough the three worlds confess him lord,\\nMust perish dreaded and abhorred.\\nNight-rover, when a villainâ\\x80\\x99s deeds\\nDistress the world he little heeds,\\nEach hand is armed his life to take,\\nAnd crush him like a deadly snake.\\nThe end is near when men begin\\nThrough greed or lust a life of sin,\\nEâ\\x80\\x99en as a BrÃ¡hmanâ\\x80\\x99s dame, unwise,\\nEats of the fallen hail(475) and dies.\\nThy hand has slain the pure and good,\\nThe hermit saints of Daá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dak wood,\\nOf holy life, the heirs of bliss;\\nAnd thou shalt reap the fruit of this.\\nNot long shall they whose cruel breasts\\nJoy in the sin the world detests\\nRetain their guilty power and pride,\\nBut fade like trees whose roots are dried.\\nYes, as the seasons come and go,\\nEach tree its kindly fruit must show,\\nAnd sinners reap in fitting time\\nThe harvest of each earlier crime.\\nAs those must surely die who eat\\nUnwittingly of poisoned meat,\\nThey too whose lives in sin are spent\\nReceive ere long the punishment.\\nAnd know, thou rover of the night,\\nThat I, a king, am sent to smite\\nThe wicked down, who court the hate\\nOf men whose laws they violate.\\nThis day my vengeful hand shall send\\nShafts bright with gold to tear and rend,\\nAnd pass with fury through thy breast\\nAs serpents pierce an emmetâ\\x80\\x99s nest.\\nThou with thy host this day shalt be\\nAmong the dead below, and see\\nThe saints beneath thy hand who bled,\\nWhose flesh thy cruel maw has fed.\\nThey, glorious on their seats of gold,\\nTheir slayer shall in hell behold.\\nFight with all strength thou callest thine,\\nMean scion of ignoble line,\\nStill, like the palm-treeâ\\x80\\x99s fruit, this day\\nMy shafts thy head in dust shall lay.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Such were the words that RÃ¡ma said:\\nThen Kharaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes with wrath glowed red,\\nWho, maddened by the rage that burned\\nWithin him, with a smile returned:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cThou DaÅ\\x9barathaâ\\x80\\x99s son, hast slain\\nThe meaner giants of my train:\\nAnd canst thou idly vaunt thy might\\nAnd claim the praise not thine by right?\\nNot thus in self-laudation rave\\nThe truly great, the nobly brave:\\nNo empty boasts like thine disgrace\\nThe foremost of the human race.\\nThe mean of soul, unknown to fame,\\nWho taint their warrior race with shame,\\nThus speak in senseless pride as thou,\\nO Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, hast boasted now.\\nWhat hero, when the war-cry rings,\\nVaunts the high race from which he springs,\\nOr seeks, when warriors meet and die,\\nHis own descent to glorify?\\nWeakness and folly show confessed\\nIn every vaunt thou utterest,\\nAs when the flames fed high with grass\\nDetect the simulating brass.\\nDost thou not see me standing here\\nArmed with the mighty mace I rear,\\nFirm as an earth upholding hill\\nWhose summit veins of metal fill?\\nLo, here I stand before thy face\\nTo slay thee with my murderous mace,\\nAs Death, the universal lord,\\nStands threatening with his fatal cord.\\nEnough of this. Much more remains\\nThat should be said: but time constrains.\\nEre to his rest the sun descend,\\nAnd shades of night the combat end,\\nThe twice seven thousand of my band\\nWho fell beneath thy bloody hand\\nShall have their tears all wiped away\\nAnd triumph in thy fall to-day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He spoke, and loosing from his hold\\nHis mighty mace ringed round with gold,\\nLike some red bolt alive with fire\\nHurled it at RÃ¡ma, mad with ire.\\nThe ponderous mace which Khara threw\\nSent fiery flashes as it flew.\\nTrees, shrubs were scorched beneath the blast,\\nAs onward to its aim it passed.\\nBut RÃ¡ma, watching as it sped\\nDire as His noose who rules the dead,\\nCleft it with arrows as it came\\nOn rushing with a hiss and flame.\\nIts fury spent and burnt away,\\nHarmless upon the ground it lay\\nLike a great snake in furious mood\\nBy herbs of numbing power subdued.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XXX. Kharaâ\\x80\\x99s Death.\\n\\n\\n  When RÃ¡ma, pride of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s race,\\nVirtueâ\\x80\\x99s dear son, had cleft the mace,\\nThus with superior smile the best\\nOf chiefs the furious fiend addressed:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cThou, worst of giant blood, at length\\nHast shown the utmost of thy strength,\\nAnd forced by greater might to bow,\\nThy vaunting threats are idle now.\\nMy shafts have cut thy club in twain:\\nUseless it lies upon the plain,\\nAnd all thy pride and haughty trust\\nLie with it levelled in the dust.\\nThe words that thou hast said to-day,\\nThat thou wouldst wipe the tears away\\nOf all the giants I have slain,\\nMy deeds shall render void and vain.\\nThou meanest of the giantsâ\\x80\\x99 breed,\\nEvil in thought and word and deed,\\nMy hand shall take that life of thine\\nAs Garuá¸\\x8d(476) seized the juice divine.\\nThou, rent by shafts, this day shalt die:\\nLow on the ground thy corse shall lie,\\nAnd bubbles from the cloven neck\\nWith froth and blood thy skin shall deck.\\nWith dust and mire all rudely dyed,\\nThy torn arms lying by thy side,\\nWhile streams of blood each limb shall steep,\\nThou on earthâ\\x80\\x99s breast shalt take thy sleep\\nLike a fond lover when he strains\\nThe beauty whom at length he gains.\\nNow when thy heavy eyelids close\\nFor ever in thy deep repose,\\nAgain shall Daá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dak forest be\\nSafe refuge for the devotee.\\nThou slain, and all thy race who held\\nThe realm of JanasthÃ¡n expelled,\\nAgain shall happy hermits rove,\\nFearing no danger, through the grove.\\nWithin those bounds, their brethren slain,\\nNo giant shall this day remain,\\nBut all shall fly with many a tear\\nAnd fearing, rid the saints of fear.\\nThis bitter day shall misery bring\\nOn all the race that calls thee king.\\nFierce as their lord, thy dames shall know,\\nBereft of joys, the taste of woe.\\nBase, cruel wretch, of evil mind,\\nPlaguer of BrÃ¡hmans and mankind,\\nWith trembling hands each devotee\\nFeeds holy fires in dread of thee.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus with wild fury unrepressed\\nRaghuâ\\x80\\x99s brave son the fiend addressed;\\nAnd Khara, as his wrath grew high,\\nThus thundered forth his fierce reply:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cBy senseless pride to madness wrought,\\nBy danger girt thou fearest naught,\\nNor heedest, numbered with the dead,\\nWhat thou shouldst say and leave unsaid.\\nWhen Fateâ\\x80\\x99s tremendous coils enfold\\nThe captive in resistless hold,\\nHe knows not right from wrong, each sense\\nNumbed by that deadly influence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He spoke, and when his speech was done\\nBent his fierce brows on Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son.\\nWith eager eyes he looked around\\nIf lethal arms might yet be found.\\nNot far away and full in view\\nA SÃ¡l-tree towering upward grew.\\nHis lips in mighty strain compressed,\\nHe tore it up with root and crest,\\nWith huge arms waved it oâ\\x80\\x99er his head\\nAnd hurled it shouting, Thou art dead.\\nBut RÃ¡ma, unsurpassed in might,\\nStayed with his shafts its onward flight,\\nAnd furious longing seized his soul\\nThe giant in the dust to roll.\\nGreat drops of sweat each limb bedewed,\\nHis red eyes showed his wrathful mood.\\nA thousand arrows, swiftly sent,\\nThe giantâ\\x80\\x99s bosom tore and rent.\\nFrom every gash his body showed\\nThe blood in foamy torrents flowed,\\nAs springing from their caverns leap\\nSwift rivers down the mountain steep.\\nWhen Khara felt each deadened power\\nYielding beneath that murderous shower,\\nHe charged, infuriate with the scent\\nOf blood, in dire bewilderment.\\nBut RÃ¡ma watched, with ready bow,\\nThe onset of his bleeding foe,\\nAnd ere the monster reached him, drew\\nBackward in haste a yard or two.\\nThen from his side a shaft he took\\nWhose mortal stroke no life might brook:\\nOf peerless might, it bore the name\\nOf BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s staff, and glowed with flame:\\nLord Indra, ruler of the skies,\\nHimself had given the glorious prize.\\nHis bow the virtuous hero drew,\\nAnd at the fiend the arrow flew.\\nHissing and roaring like the blast\\nOf tempest through the air it passed,\\nAnd fixed, by RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s vigour sped,\\nIn the foeâ\\x80\\x99s breast its pointed head.\\nThen fell the fiend: the quenchless flame\\nBurnt furious in his wounded frame.\\nSo burnt by Rudra Andhak(477) fell\\nIn Å\\x9avetÃ¡raá¹\\x87yaâ\\x80\\x99s silvery dell:\\nSo Namuchi and Vritra(478) died\\nBy steaming bolts that tamed their pride:\\nSo Bala(479) fell by lightning sent\\nBy Him who rules the firmament.\\n\\n  Then all the Gods in close array\\nWith the bright hosts who sing and play,\\nFilled full of rapture and amaze,\\nSang hymns of joy in RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s praise,\\nBeat their celestial drums and shed\\nRain of sweet flowers upon his head.\\nFor three short hours had scarcely flown,\\nAnd by his pointed shafts oâ\\x80\\x99erthrown\\nThe twice seven thousand fiends, whose will\\nCould change their shapes, in death were still,\\nWith TriÅ\\x9birÃ¡s and DÃºshaá¹\\x87 slain,\\nAnd Khara, leader of the train.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO wondrous deed,â\\x80\\x9d the bards

train\\nTurned to their heavenly homes again.\\nThen the high saints of royal race\\nAnd loftiest station sought the place,\\nAnd by the great Agastya led,\\nWith reverence to RÃ¡ma said:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cFor this, Lord Indra, glorious sire,\\nMajestic as the burning fire,\\nWho crushes cities in his rage,\\nSought Å\\x9aarabhangaâ\\x80\\x99s hermitage.\\nThou wast, this great design to

beaming from his face,\\nResought the hermit dwelling-place.\\nThen when the mighty saints had paid\\nDue honour for the victorâ\\x80\\x99s aid,\\nThe glorious RÃ¡ma honoured too\\nBy Lakshmaá¹\\x87 to his cot withdrew.\\nWhen SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ looked upon her lord,\\nHis foemen slain, the saints restored,\\nIn pride and rapture uncontrolled\\nShe clasped him in her loving hold.\\nOn the dead fiends her glances fell:\\nShe saw her lord alive and well,\\nVictorious after toil and pain,\\nAnd Janakâ\\x80\\x99s child was blest again.\\nOnce more, once more with new delight\\n  Her tender arms she threw\\nRound RÃ¡ma whose victorious might\\n  Had crushed the demon crew.\\nThen as his grateful reverence paid\\n  Each saint of lofty soul,\\nOâ\\x80\\x99er her sweet face, all fears allayed,\\n  The flush of transport stole.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XXXI.

â\\x80\\x9cKing, many a giant from the shade\\nOf JanasthÃ¡n in death is laid:\\nKhara the chief is slain, and I\\nCould scarcely from the battle fly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Fierce anger, as the monarch heard,\\nInflamed his look, his bosom stirred,\\nAnd while with scorching glance he eyed\\nThe messenger, he thus replied:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cWhat fool has dared, already dead,\\nStrike JanasthÃ¡n, the general dread?\\nWho is the wretch shall vainly try\\nIn earth, heaven, hell, from me to fly?\\nVaiÅ\\x9bravaá¹\\x87,(481) Indra, Vishá¹\\x87u, He\\nWho rules the dead, must reverence me;\\nFor not the mightiest lord of these\\nCan brave my will and live at ease.\\nFate finds in me a mightier fate\\nTo burn the fires that devastate.\\nWith unresisted influence I\\nCan force eâ\\x80\\x99en Death himself to die,\\nWith all-surpassing might restrain\\nThe fury of the hurricane,\\nAnd burn in my tremendous ire\\nThe glory of the sun and fire.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  As thus the fiendâ\\x80\\x99s hot fury blazed,\\nHis trembling hands Akampan raised,\\nAnd with a voice which fear made weak,\\nPermission craved his tale to speak.\\nKing RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 gave the leave he sought,\\nAnd bade him tell the news he brought.\\nHis courage rose, his voice grew bold,\\nAnd thus his mournful tale he told:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cA prince with mighty shoulders, sprung\\nFrom DaÅ\\x9baratha, brave and young,\\nWith arms well moulded, bears the name\\nOf RÃ¡ma with a lionâ\\x80\\x99s frame.\\nRenowned, successful, dark of limb,\\nEarth has no warrior equals him.\\nHe fought in JanasthÃ¡n and slew\\nDÃºshaá¹\\x87 the fierce and Khara too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 the giantsâ\\x80\\x99 royal chief.\\nReceived Akampanâ\\x80\\x99s tale of grief.\\nThen, panting like an angry snake,\\nThese words in turn the monarch spake:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cSay quick, did RÃ¡ma seek the shade\\nOf JanasthÃ¡n with Indraâ\\x80\\x99s aid,\\nAnd all the dwellers in the skies\\nTo back his hardy enterprise?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Akampan heard, and straight obeyed\\nHis master, and his answer made.\\nThen thus the power and might he told\\nOf Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son the lofty-souled:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cBest is that chief of all who know\\nWith deftest art to draw the bow.\\nHis are strange arms of heavenly might,\\nAnd none can match him in the fight.\\nHis brother Lakshmaá¹\\x87 brave as he,\\nFair as the rounded moon to see,\\nWith eyes like night and voice that comes\\nDeep as the roll of beaten drums,\\nBy RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s side stands ever near,\\nLike wind that aids the flameâ\\x80\\x99s career.\\nThat glorious chief, that prince of kings,\\nOn JanasthÃ¡n this ruin brings.\\nNo Gods were there,â\\x80\\x94dismiss the thought\\nNo heavenly legions came and fought.\\nHis swift-winged arrows RÃ¡ma sent,\\nEach bright with gold and ornament.\\nTo serpents many-faced they turned:\\nThe giant hosts they ate and burned.\\nWhereâ\\x80\\x99er these fled in wild dismay\\nRÃ¡ma was there to strike and slay.\\nBy him O King of high estate,\\nIs JanasthÃ¡n left desolate.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Akampan ceased: in angry pride\\nThe giant monarch thus replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo JanasthÃ¡n myself will go\\nAnd lay these daring brothers low.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus spoke the king in furious mood:\\nAkampan then his speech renewed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO listen while I tell at length\\nThe terror of the heroâ\\x80\\x99s strength.\\nNo power can check, no might can tame\\nRÃ¡ma, a chief of noblest fame.\\nHe with resistless shafts can stay\\nThe torrent foaming on its way.\\nSky, stars, and constellations, all\\nTo his fierce might would yield and fall.\\nHis power could earth itself uphold\\nDown sinking as it sank of old.(482)\\nOr all its plains and cities drown,\\nBreaking the wild seaâ\\x80\\x99s barrier down;\\nCrush the great deepâ\\x80\\x99s impetuous will,\\nOr bid the furious wind be still.\\nHe glorious in his high estate\\nThe triple world could devastate,\\nAnd there, supreme of men, could place\\nHis creatures of a new-born race.\\nNever can mighty RÃ¡ma be\\nOâ\\x80\\x99ercome in fight, my King, by thee.\\nThy giant host the day might win\\nFrom him, if heaven were gained by sin.\\nIf Gods were joined with demons, they\\nCould neâ\\x80\\x99er, I ween, that hero slay,\\nBut guile may kill the wondrous man;\\nAttend while I disclose the plan.\\nHis wife, above all women graced,\\nIs SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ of the dainty waist,\\nWith limbs to fair proportion true,\\nAnd a soft skin of lustrous hue,\\nRound neck and arm rich gems are twined:\\nShe is the gem of womankind.\\nWith her no bright GandharvÃ\\xad vies,\\nNo nymph or Goddess in the skies;\\nAnd none to rival her would dare\\nâ\\x80\\x99Mid dames who part the long black hair.\\nThat hero in the wood beguile,\\nAnd steal his lovely spouse the while.\\nReft of his darling wife, be sure,\\nBrief days the mourner will endure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  With flattering hope of triumph moved\\nThe giant king that plan approved,\\nPondered the counsel in his breast,\\nAnd then Akampan thus addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cForth in my car I go at morn,\\nNone but the driver with me borne,\\nAnd this fair SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ will I bring\\nBack to my city triumphing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Forth in his car by asses drawn\\nThe giant monarch sped at dawn,\\nBright as the sun, the chariot cast\\nLight through the sky as on it passed.\\nThen high in air that best of cars\\nTraversed the path of lunar stars,\\nSending a fitful radiance pale\\nAs moonbeams shot through cloudy veil.\\nFar on his airy way he flew:\\nNear TÃ¡á¸\\x8dakeyaâ\\x80\\x99s(483) grove he drew.\\nMÃ¡rÃ\\xadcha welcomed him, and placed\\nBefore him food which giants taste,\\nWith honour led him to a seat,\\nAnd brought him water for his feet;\\nAnd then with timely words addressed\\nSuch question to his royal guest:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cSpeak, is it well with thee whose sway\\nThe giant multitudes obey?\\nI know not all, and ask in fear\\nThe cause, O King, why thou art here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  RÃ¡va, the giantsâ\\x80\\x99 mighty king,\\nHeard wise MÃ¡rÃ\\xadchaâ\\x80\\x99s questioning,\\nAnd told with ready answer, taught\\nIn eloquence, the cause he sought:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy guards, the bravest of my band,\\nAre slain by RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s vigorous hand,\\nAnd JanasthÃ¡n, that feared no hate\\nOf foes, is rendered desolate.\\nCome, aid me in the plan I lay\\nTo steal the conquerorâ\\x80\\x99s wife away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  MÃ¡rÃ\\xadcha heard the kingâ\\x80\\x99s request,\\nAnd thus the giant chief addressed:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cWhat foe in

say,\\nThat bids thee bear his wife away,\\nAnd careless of thy life provoke\\nEarthâ\\x80\\x99s loftiest with threatening stroke?\\nA foe is he who dared suggest\\nThis hopeless folly to thy breast,\\nWhose ill advice would bid thee draw\\nThe venomed fang from serpentâ\\x80\\x99s jaw.\\nBy whose unwise suggestion led\\nWilt thou the path of ruin tread?\\nWhence falls the blow that would destroy\\nThy gentle sleep of ease and joy?\\n  Like some wild elephant is he\\n    That rears his trunk on high,\\n  Lord of an ancient pedigree,\\n    Huge tusks, and furious eye.\\n  RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87, no rover of the night\\n    With bravest heart can brook,\\n  Met in the front of deadly fight,\\n    On Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son to look.\\n  The giant hosts were brave and strong,\\n    Good at the bow and spear:\\n  But RÃ¡ma slew the routed throng,\\n    A lion â\\x80\\x99mid the deer.\\n  No lionâ\\x80\\x99s tooth can match his sword,\\n    Or arrows fiercely shot:\\n  He sleeps, he

sink:\\n  A hell, where deadly shafts are sent\\n    From his tremendous-bow,\\n  While his great arms all flight prevent,\\n    Like deepest mire below:\\n  Where the wild floods of battle rave\\n    Above the foemanâ\\x80\\x99s head,\\n  And each with many a feathery wave\\n    Of shafts is garlanded.\\n  O, quench the flames that in thy breast\\n    With raging fury burn;\\n  And pacified and

still be spent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The lord of LankÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s isle obeyed\\nThe counsel, and his purpose stayed.\\nBorne on his car he parted thence\\nAnd gained his royal

adorns,\\nAnd sapphires tip its branching horns.\\nResplendent as the lunar way,\\nOr the first blush of opening day,\\nWith graceful form and radiant hue\\nIt charmed thy heart, O chieftain, too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He heard her speech with willing ear,\\nHe looked again upon the deer.\\nIts lovely shape his breast beguiled\\nMoved by the prayer of Janakâ\\x80\\x99s child,\\nAnd yielding

round them lay\\nIkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s children made their way,\\nAnd armed with bow and shaft and brand\\nPressed onward to the southern land.\\nThick trees and shrubs and creepers grew\\nIn the wild grove they hurried through.\\nâ\\x80\\x99Twas dark and drear and hard to pass\\nFor tangled thorns and matted grass.\\nStill onward with a southern course\\nThey made their way with vigorous force,\\nAnd passing through the mazes stood\\nBeyond that vast and fearful wood.\\nWith toil and hardship yet unspent\\nThree leagues from JanasthÃ¡n they went,\\nAnd speeding on their way at last\\nWithin the wood of Krauncha(515) passed:\\nA fearful forest wild and black\\nAs some huge pile of cloudy rack,\\nFilled with all birds and beasts, where grew\\nBright blooms of every varied hue.\\nOn SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ bending every thought\\nThrough all the mighty wood they sought,\\nAnd at the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s loss dismayed\\nHere for a while and there they stayed.\\nThen turning farther eastward they\\nPursued three leagues their weary way,\\nPassed Kraunchaâ\\x80\\x99s wood and reached the grove\\nWhere elephants rejoiced to rove.\\nThe chiefs that awful wood surveyed\\nWhere deer and wild birds filled each glade,\\nWhere scarce a step the foot could take\\nFor tangled shrub and tree and brake.\\nThere in a mountainâ\\x80\\x99s woody side\\nA cave the royal brothers spied,\\nWith dread abysses deep as hell,\\nWhere darkness never ceased to dwell.\\nWhen, pressing on, the lords of men\\nStood near the entrance of the den,\\nThey saw within the dark recess\\nA huge misshapen giantess;\\nA thing the timid heart that shook\\nWith fearful shape and savage look.\\nTerrific fiend, her voice was fierce,\\nLong were her teeth to rend and pierce.\\nThe monster gorged her horrid feast\\nOf flesh of many a savage beast,\\nWhile her long locks, at random flung,\\nDishevelled oâ\\x80\\x99er her shoulders hung.\\nTheir eyes the royal brothers raised,\\nAnd on the fearful monster gazed.\\nForth from her den she came and glanced\\nAt Lakshmaá¹\\x87 as he first advanced,\\nHer eager arms to hold him spread,\\nAnd â\\x80\\x9cCome and be my loveâ\\x80\\x9d she said,\\nThen as she held him to her breast,\\nThe prince in words like these addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBehold thy treasure fond and fair:\\nAyomukhi(516) the name I bear.\\nIn thickets of each lofty hill,\\nOn islets of each brook and rill,\\nWith me delighted shalt thou play,\\nAnd live for many a lengthened day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Enraged he heard the monster woo;\\nHis ready sword he swiftly drew,\\nAnd the sharp steel that quelled his foes\\nCut through her breast and ear and nose.\\nThus mangled by his vengeful sword\\nIn rage and pain the demon roared,\\nAnd hideous with her awful face\\nSped to her secret dwelling place.\\nSoon as the fiend had fled from sight,\\nThe brothers, dauntless in their might,\\nReached a wild forest dark and dread\\nWhose tangled ways were hard to tread.\\nThen bravest Lakshmaá¹\\x87, virtuous youth,\\nThe friend of purity and truth,\\nWith reverent palm to palm applied\\nThus to his glorious brother cried:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cMy arm presaging throbs amain,\\nMy troubled heart is sick with pain,\\nAnd cheerless omens ill portend\\nWhereâ\\x80\\x99er my anxious eyes I bend.\\nDear brother, hear my words: advance\\nResolved and armed for every chance,\\nFor every sign I mark to-day\\nForetells a peril in the way.\\nThis bird of most ill-omened note,\\nLoud screaming with discordant throat,\\nAnnounces with a warning cry\\nThat strife and victory are nigh.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then as the chiefs their search pursued\\nThroughout the dreary solitude,\\nThey heard amazed a mighty sound\\nThat broke the very trees around,\\nAs though a furious tempest passed\\nCrushing the wood beneath its blast.\\nThen RÃ¡ma raised his trusty sword,\\nAnd both the hidden cause explored.\\nThere stood before their wondering eyes\\nA fiend broad-chested, huge of size.\\nA vast misshapen trunk they saw\\nIn height surpassing natureâ\\x80\\x99s law.\\nIt stood before them dire and dread\\nWithout a neck, without a head.\\nTall as some hill aloft in air,\\nIts limbs were clothed with bristling hair,\\nAnd deep below the monsterâ\\x80\\x99s waist\\nHis vast misshapen mouth was placed.\\nHis form was huge, his voice was loud\\nAs some dark-tinted thunder cloud.\\nForth from his ample chest there came\\nA brilliance as of gushing flame.\\nBeneath long lashes, dark and keen\\nThe monsterâ\\x80\\x99s single eye was seen.\\nDeep in his chest, long, fiercely bright,\\nIt glittered with terrific light.\\nHe swallowed down his savage fare\\nOf lion, bird, and slaughtered bear,\\nAnd with huge teeth exposed to view\\nOâ\\x80\\x99er his great lips his tongue he drew.\\nHis arms unshapely, vast and dread,\\nA league in length, he raised and spread.\\nHe seized with monstrous hands a herd\\nOf deer and many a bear and bird.\\nAmong them all he picked and chose,\\nDrew forward these, rejected those.\\nBefore the princely pair he stood\\nBarring their passage through the wood.\\nA league of shade the chiefs had passed\\nWhen on the fiend their eyes they cast.\\nA monstrous shape without a head\\nWith mighty arms before him spread,\\nThey saw that hideous trunk appear\\nThat struck the trembling eye with fear.\\nThen, stretching to their full extent\\nHis awful arms with fingers bent,\\nRound Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s princely sons he cast\\nEach grasping limb and held them fast.\\nThough strong of arm and fierce in fight,\\nEach armed with bow and sword to smite,\\nThe royal brothers, brave and bold,\\nWere helpless in the giantâ\\x80\\x99s hold.\\nThen Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, heroic still,\\nFelt not a pang his bosom thrill;\\nBut young, with no protection near,\\nHis brotherâ\\x80\\x99s heart was sad with fear,\\nAnd thus with trembling tongue he said\\nTo RÃ¡ma, sore disquieted:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cAh me, ah me, my days are told:\\nO see me in the giantâ\\x80\\x99s hold.\\nFly, son of Raghu, swiftly flee,\\nAnd thy dear self from danger free.\\nMe to the fiend an offering give;\\nFly at thine ease thyself and live.\\nThou, great Kakutsthaâ\\x80\\x99s son, I ween,\\nWilt find ere long thy Maithil queen,\\nAnd when thou holdest, throned again,\\nThine old hereditary reign,\\nWith servants prompt to do thy will,\\nO think upon thy brother still.â\\x80\\x9d\\nAs thus the trembling Lakshmaá¹\\x87 cried,\\nThe dauntless RÃ¡ma thus replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBrother, from causeless dread forbear.\\nA chief like thee should scorn despair.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe spoke to soothe his wild alarm:\\nThen fierce Kabandha(517) long of arm,\\nAmong the DÃ¡navs(518) first and best,\\nThe sons of Raghu thus addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat men are you, whose shoulders show\\nBroad as a bullâ\\x80\\x99s, with sword and bow,\\nWho roam this dark and horrid place,\\nBrought by your fate before my face?\\nDeclare by what occasion led\\nThese solitary wilds you tread,\\nWith swords and bows and shafts to pierce,\\nLike bulls whose horns are strong and fierce.\\nWhy have you sought this forest land\\nWhere wild with hungerâ\\x80\\x99s pangs I stand?\\nNow as your steps my path have crossed\\nEsteem your lives already lost.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The royal brothers heard with dread\\nThe words which fierce Kabandha said.\\nAnd RÃ¡ma to his brother cried,\\nWhose cheek by blanching fear was dried:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cAlas, we fall, O valiant chief,\\nFrom sorrow into direr grief,\\nStill mourning her I hold so dear\\nWe see our own destruction near.\\nMark, brother, mark what power has time\\nOâ\\x80\\x99er all that live, in every clime.\\nNow, lord of men, thyself and me\\nInvolved in fatal danger see.\\nâ\\x80\\x99Tis not, be sure, the might of Fate\\nThat crushes all with deadly weight.\\nNeâ\\x80\\x99er can the brave and strong, who know\\nThe use of spear and sword and bow,\\nThe force of conquering time withstand,\\nBut fall like barriers built of sand.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThus in calm strength which naught could shake\\nThe son of DaÅ\\x9baratha spake,\\n  With glory yet unstained\\nUpon SumitrÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s son he bent\\nHis eyes, and firm in his intent\\n  His dauntless heart maintained.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LXXI. Kabandhaâ\\x80\\x99s Speech.\\n\\n\\nKabandha saw each chieftain stand\\nImprisoned by his mighty hand,\\nWhich like a snare around him pressed\\nAnd thus the royal pair addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, warriors, are your glances bent\\nOn me whom hungry pangs torment?\\nWhy stand with wildered senses? Fate\\nHas brought you now my maw to sate.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  When Lakshmaá¹\\x87 heard, a while appalled,\\nHis ancient courage he recalled,\\nAnd to his brother by his side\\nWith seasonable counsel cried:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cThis vilest of the giant race\\nWill draw us to his side apace.\\nCome, rouse thee; let the vengeful sword\\nSmite off his arms, my honoured lord.\\nThis awful giant, vast of size,\\nOn his huge strength of arm relies,\\nAnd oâ\\x80\\x99er the world victorious, thus\\nWith mighty force would slaughter us.\\nBut in cold blood to slay, O King,\\nDiscredit on the brave would bring,\\nAs when some victim in the rite\\nShuns not the hand upraised to smite.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The monstrous fiend, to anger stirred,\\nThe converse of the brothers heard.\\nHis horrid mouth he opened wide\\nAnd drew the princes to his side.\\nThey, skilled due time and place to note\\nUnsheathed their glittering swords and smote,\\nTill from the giantâ\\x80\\x99s shoulders they\\nHad hewn the mighty arms away.\\nHis trenchant falchion RÃ¡ma plied\\nAnd smote him on the better side,\\nWhile valiant Lakshmaá¹\\x87 on the left\\nThe arm that held him prisoned cleft.\\nThen to the earth dismembered fell\\nThe monster with a hideous yell,\\nAnd like a cloudâ\\x80\\x99s his deep roar went\\nThrough earth and air and firmament.\\nThen as the giantâ\\x80\\x99s blood flowed fast,\\nOn his cleft limbs his eye he cast,\\nAnd called upon the princely pair\\nTheir names and lineage to declare.\\nHim then the noble Lakshmaá¹\\x87, blest\\nWith fortuneâ\\x80\\x99s favouring marks, addressed,\\nAnd told the fiend his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s name\\nAnd the high blood of which he came:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s heir here RÃ¡ma stands,\\nIllustrious through a hundred lands.\\nI, younger brother of the heir,\\nO fiend, the name of Lakshmaá¹\\x87 bear.\\nHis mother stole his realm away\\nAnd drove him forth in woods to stray.\\nThus through the mighty forest he\\nRoamed with his royal wife and me.\\nWhile glorious as a God he made\\nHis dwelling in the greenwood shade,\\nSome giant stole away his dame,\\nAnd seeking her we hither came.\\nBut tell me who thou art, and why\\nWith headless trunk that towered so high,\\nWith flaming face beneath thy chest,\\nThou liest crushed in wild unrest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He heard the words that Lakshmaá¹\\x87 spoke,\\nAnd memory in his breast awoke,\\nRecalling Indraâ\\x80\\x99s words to mind\\nHe spoke in gentle tones and kind:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO welcome best of men, are ye\\nWhom, blest by fate, this day I see.\\nA blessing on each trenchant blade\\nThat low on earth these arms has laid!\\nThou, lord of men, incline thine ear\\nThe story of my woe to hear,\\nWhile I the rebel pride declare\\nWhich doomed me to the form I wear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LXXII.

each consecrated bower.\\nThrough many an age those trees have stood\\nWorld-famous as Matangaâ\\x80\\x99s wood\\nStill, Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, pursue thy way:\\nThrough shades where birds are vocal stray,\\nFair as the blessed wood where rove\\nImmortal Gods, or Nandanâ\\x80\\x99s grove.\\nNear PampÃ¡ eastward, full in sight,\\nStands RishyamÃºkaâ\\x80\\x99s wood-crowned height.\\nâ\\x80\\x99Tis hard to climb that towering steep\\nWhere serpents unmolested sleep.\\nThe free and bounteous, formed of old\\nBy BrahmÃ¡ of superior mould,\\nWho sink when day is done to rest\\nReclining on that mountain crest,â\\x80\\x94\\nWhat wealth or joy in dreams they view,\\nAwaking find the vision true.\\nBut if a villain stained with crime\\nThat holy hill presume to climb,\\nThe giants in their fury sweep\\nFrom the hill top the wretch asleep.\\nThere loud and long is heard the roar\\nOf elephants on PampÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s shore,\\nWho near Matangaâ\\x80\\x99s dwelling stray\\nAnd in those waters bathe and play.\\nA while they revel by the flood,\\nTheir temples stained with streams like blood,\\nThen wander far away dispersed,\\nDark as huge clouds before they burst.\\nBut ere they part they drink their fill\\nOf bright pure water from the rill,\\nDelightful to the touch, where meet\\nScents of all flowers divinely sweet,\\nThen speeding from the river side\\nDeep in the sheltering thicket hide.\\nThen bears and tigers shalt thou view\\nWhose soft skins show the sapphireâ\\x80\\x99s hue,\\nAnd silvan deer that wander nigh\\nShall harmless from thy presence fly.\\nHigh in that mountainâ\\x80\\x99s wooded side\\nIs a fair cavern deep and wide,\\nYet hard to enter: piles of rock\\nThe portals of the cavern block.(521)\\nFast by the eastern door a pool\\nGleams with broad waters fresh and cool,\\nWhere stores of roots and fruit abound,\\nAnd thick trees shade the grassy ground.\\nThis mountain cave the virtuous-souled\\nSugrÃ\\xadva, and his VÃ¡nars hold,\\nAnd oft the mighty chieftain seeks\\nThe summits of those towering peaks.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus spake Kabandha high in air\\nHis counsel to the royal pair.\\nStill on his neck that wreath he bore,\\nAnd radiance like the sunâ\\x80\\x99s he wore.\\nTheir eyes the princely brothers raised\\nAnd on that blissful being gazed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBehold, we go: no more delay;\\nBegin,â\\x80\\x9d they cried, â\\x80\\x9cthy heavenward way.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDepart,â\\x80\\x9d Kabandhaâ\\x80\\x99s voice replied,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPursue your search, and bliss betide.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus to the happy chiefs he said,\\nThen on his heavenward journey sped.\\nThus once again Kabandha won\\nA shape that glittered like the sun\\n  Without a spot or stain.\\nThus bade he RÃ¡ma from the air\\nTo great SugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s side repair\\n  His friendly love to gain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LXXV. SavarÃ\\xad.\\n\\n\\nThus counselled by their friendly guide\\nOn through the wood the princes hied,\\nPursuing still the eastern road\\nTo PampÃ¡ which Kabandha showed,\\nWhere trees that on the mountains grew\\nWith fruit like honey charmed the view.\\nThey rested weary for the night\\nUpon a mountainâ\\x80\\x99s wooded height,\\nThen onward with the dawn they hied\\nAnd stood on PampÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s western side,\\nWhere Å\\x9aavarÃ\\xadâ\\x80\\x99s fair home they viewed\\nDeep in that shady solitude.\\nThe princes reached the holy ground\\nWhere noble trees stood thick around,\\nAnd joying in the lovely view\\nNear to the aged votaress drew.\\nTo meet the sons of Raghu came,\\nWith hands upraised, the pious dame,\\nAnd bending low with reverence meet\\nWelcomed them both and pressed their feet.\\nThen water, as beseems, she gave,\\nTheir lips to cool, their feet to lave.\\nTo that pure saint who never broke\\nOne law of duty RÃ¡ma spoke:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cI trust no cares invade thy peace,\\nWhile holy works and zeal increase;\\nThat thou content with scanty food\\nAll touch of ire hast long subdued;\\nThat all thy vows are well maintained\\nWhile peace of mind is surely gained,\\nThat reverence of the saints who taught\\nThy faithful heart due fruit has brought.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The aged votaress pure of taint,\\nRevered by every perfect saint,\\nRose to her feet by RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s side\\nAnd thus in gentle tones replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy penance meed this day I see\\nComplete, my lord, in meeting thee.\\nThis day the fruit of birth I gain,\\nNor have I served the saints in vain.\\nI reap rich fruits of toil and vow,\\nAnd heaven itself awaits me now,\\nWhen I, O chief of men, have done\\nHonour to thee the godlike one.\\nI feel, great lord, thy gentle eye\\nMy earthly spirit purify,\\nAnd I, brave tamer of thy foes,\\nShall through thy grace in bliss repose.\\nThy feet by ChitrakÃºá¹\\xada strayed\\nWhen those great saints whom I obeyed,\\nIn dazzling chariots bright of hue,\\nHence to their heavenly mansions flew.\\nAs the high saints were borne away\\nI heard their holy voices say:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn this pure grove, O devotee,\\nPrince RÃ¡ma soon will visit thee.\\nWhen he and Lakshmaá¹\\x87 seek this shade,\\nBe to thy guests all honour paid.\\nHim shalt thou see, and pass away\\nTo those blest worlds which neâ\\x80\\x99er decay.â\\x80\\x9d\\nTo me, O mighty chief, the best\\nOf lofty saints these words addressed.\\nLaid up within my dwelling lie\\nFruits of each sort which woods supply,â\\x80\\x94\\nFood culled for thee in endless store\\nFrom every tree on PampÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s shore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus to her virtuous guest she sued\\nAnd he, with heavenly lore endued,\\nWords such as these in turn addressed\\nTo her with equal knowledge blest:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDanu himself the power has told\\nOf thy great masters lofty-souled.\\nNow if thou will, mine eyes would fain\\nAssurance of their glories gain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  She heard the prince his wish declare:\\nThen rose she, and the royal pair\\nOf brothers through the wood she led\\nThat round her holy dwelling spread.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBehold Matangaâ\\x80\\x99s woodâ\\x80\\x9d she cried,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA grove made famous far and wide.\\nDark as thick clouds and filled with herds\\nOf wandering deer, and joyous birds.\\nIn this pure spot each reverend sire\\nWith offerings fed the holy fire.\\nSee here the western altar stands\\nWhere daily with their trembling hands\\nThe aged saints, so long obeyed\\nBy me, their gifts of blossoms laid.\\nThe holy power, O Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son,\\nBy their ascetic virtue won,\\nStill keeps their well-loved altar bright,\\nFilling the air with beams of light.\\nAnd those seven neighbouring lakes behold\\nWhich, when the saints infirm and old,\\nWorn out by fasts, no longer sought,\\nMoved hither drawn by power of thought.\\nLook, RÃ¡ma, where the devotees\\nHung their bark mantles on the trees,\\nFresh from the bath: those garments wet\\nThrough many a day are dripping yet.\\nSee, through those aged hermitsâ\\x80\\x99 power\\nThe tender spray, this bright-hued flower\\nWith which the saints their worship paid,\\nFresh to this hour nor change nor fade.\\nHere thou hast seen each lawn and dell,\\nAnd heard the tale I had to tell:\\nPermit thy servant, lord, I pray,\\nTo cast this mortal shell away,\\nFor I would dwell, this life resigned,\\nWith those great saints of lofty mind,\\nWhom I within this holy shade\\nWith reverential care obeyed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  When RÃ¡ma and his brother heard\\nThe pious prayer the dame preferred,\\nFilled full of transport and amazed\\nThey marvelled as her words they praised.\\nThen RÃ¡ma to the votaress said\\nWhose holy vows were perfected:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo, lady, where thou fain wouldst be,\\nO thou who well hast honoured me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Her locks in hermit fashion tied,\\nClad in bark coat and black deer-hide,\\nWhen RÃ¡ma gave consent, the dame\\nResigned her body to the flame.\\nThen like the fire that burns and glows,\\nTo heaven the sainted lady rose,\\nIn all her heavenly garments dressed,\\nImmortal wreaths on neck and breast,\\nBright with celestial gems she shone\\nMost beautiful to look upon,\\nAnd like the flame of lightning sent\\nA glory through the firmament.\\nThat holy sphere the dame attained,\\nBy depth of contemplation gained,\\nWhere roam high saints with spirits pure\\nIn bliss that shall for aye endure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LXXVI.

loveâ\\x80\\x99s voluptuous glow,\\nWhen balmy sweetness fills the air,\\nAnd fruit and flowers and trees are fair.\\nThose waving woods, that shine with bloom,\\nEach varied tint in turn assume.\\nLike labouring clouds they pour their showers\\nIn rain or ever-changing flowers.\\nBehold, those forest trees, that stand\\nHigh upon rock and table-land,\\nAs the cool gales their branches bend,\\nTheir floating blossoms downward send.\\nSee, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, how the breezes play\\nWith every floweret on the spray.\\nAnd sport in merry guise with all\\nThe fallen blooms and those that fall.\\nSee, brother, where the merry breeze\\nShakes the gay boughs of flowery trees,\\nDisturbed amid their toil a throng\\nOf bees pursue him, loud in song.\\nThe KoÃ¯ls,(524) mad with sweet delight,\\nThe bending trees to dance invite;\\nAnd in its joy the wild wind sings\\nAs from the mountain cave he springs.\\nOn speed the gales in rapid course,\\nAnd bend the woods beneath their

magic of their gentle touch.\\nHark, when the gale the boughs has bent\\nIn woods of honey redolent,\\nThrough all their quivering sprays the trees\\nAre vocal with the murmuring bees.\\nThe hills

creeper, shrub, and plant alight,\\nOr wing from tree to tree their flight.\\nEach bird his kindly mate has found,\\nAnd loud their notes of triumph sound,\\nBlending in sweetest music like\\nThe

the fields of air\\nWill aid my love with friendly care,\\nAnd me with gracious pity guide\\nTo my large-eyed Videhanâ\\x80\\x99s side.(529)\\nHark, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, how the woods around\\nWith love-inspiring chants resound,\\nWhere birds in every bloom-crowned tree\\nPour forth their amorous minstrelsy.\\nAs though an eager gallant wooed\\nA gentle maid by love subdued,\\nEnamoured of her flowers the bee\\nDarts at the wind-rocked Tila tree.(530)\\nAÅ\\x9boka, brightest tree that grows,\\nThat lends a pang to loversâ\\x80\\x99 woes,\\nHangs out his gorgeous bloom in scorn\\nAnd mocks

loved retreat,\\nShows her glad waters bright and clear,\\nWhere lotuses their heads uprear\\nFrom the pure wave, and charm the view\\nWith mingled tints of red and blue.\\nEach like the morningâ\\x80\\x99s early beams\\nReflected in the crystal gleams;\\nAnd bees on their sweet toil intent\\nWeigh down each tender filament.\\nThere with gay lawns the wood recedes;\\nThere wildfowl sport amid the reeds,\\nThere roedeer stand upon the brink,\\nAnd elephants descend to drink.\\nThe rippling waves which winds make fleet\\nAgainst the bending lilies beat,\\nAnd opening bud and

charm so sweet of yore,\\nAnd glads my widowed heart no more.\\nOn lotus buds I seem to gaze,\\nOr blooms that deck PalÃ¡Å\\x9ba(532) sprays;(533)\\n\\nBut to my tortured memory rise\\nThe glories of my darlingâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\nCool breezes through the forest stray\\nGathering odours on their way,\\nEnriched with all the rifled scent\\nOf lotus flower and filament.\\nTheir touch upon my temples falls\\nAnd SÃ\\xadtÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s fragrant breath recalls.\\nNow look, dear brother, on the right\\nOf PampÃ¡ towers a mountain height\\nWhere fairest Cassia trees unfold\\nThe treasures of their burnished gold.\\nProud mountain king! his woody side\\nWith myriad ores is decked and dyed,\\nAnd as the wind-swept blossoms fall\\nTheir fragrant dust is stained with all.\\nTo yon high lands thy

a dame by love impelled\\nWith clasping arms her lover held.\\nDrunk with the varied scents that fill\\nThe balmy air, from hill to hill,\\nFrom grove to grove, from tree to tree,\\nThe joyous wind is wandering free.\\nThese gay trees wave their branches bent\\nBy blooms, of honey redolent.\\nThere, slowly opening to the day,\\nBuds with dark lustre deck the spray.\\nThe wild bee rests a moment where\\nEach tempting flower is sweet and fair,\\nThen, coloured by the pollen dyes,\\nDeep in some odorous blossom lies.\\nSoon from his couch away he springs:\\nTo other trees his course he wings,\\nAnd tastes the honeyed blooms that grow\\nWhere PampÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s lucid waters flow.\\nSee, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, see, how thickly spread\\nWith blossoms from the trees oâ\\x80\\x99erhead,\\nThat grass the weary traveller woos\\nWith couches of a thousand hues,\\nAnd beds on every height arrayed\\nWith red and yellow tints are laid,\\nNo longer winter chills the earth:\\nA thousand flowerets spring to birth,\\nAnd trees in rivalry assume\\nTheir vernal garb of bud and bloom.\\nHow fair they look, how bright and gay\\nWith tasselled flowers on every spray!\\nWhile each to each proud challenge flings\\nBorne in the song the wild bee sings.\\nThat mallard by the river edge\\nHas bathed amid the reeds and sedge:\\nNow with his mate he fondly plays\\nAnd fires my bosom as I gaze.\\n\\n  MandÃ¡kinÃ\\xad(534) is far renowned:\\nNo lovelier flood on earth is found;\\nBut all her fairest charms combined\\nIn this sweet stream enchant the mind.\\nO, if my love were here to

resort,\\nWhere curlew, swan, and diver sport;\\nWhere with his consort plays the drake,\\nAnd tall deer love their thirst to slake,\\nWhile from each woody bank is heard\\nThe wild note of each happy bird.\\nThe music of that joyous quire\\nFills all my soul with soft desire;\\nAnd, as I hear, my sad thoughts fly\\nTo SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ of the lotus eye,\\nWhom, lovely with her moonbright cheek,\\nIn vain mine eager glances seek.\\nNow turn, those chequered lawns survey\\nWhere hart and hind together stray.\\nAh, as they wander at their will\\nMy troubled breast with grief they fill,\\nWhile torn by hopeless love I sigh\\nFor SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ of the fawn-like eye.\\nIf in those glades where, touched by spring,\\nGay birds their amorous ditties sing,\\nMine own beloved I might see,\\nThen, brother, it were well with me:\\nIf by my side she wandered still,\\nAnd this cool breeze that stirs the rill\\nTouched with its gentle breath the brows\\nOf mine own dear Videhan spouse.\\nFor, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, O

pain,\\nWhere prisoned far away she lies,â\\x80\\x94\\nMy darling of the lotus eyes?\\nHow shall I dare her sire to greet\\nWhose lips have never known deceit?\\nHow stand before the childless

bear my widowed lot,\\nAnd linger on where she is not,\\nWho followed when from home I fled\\nDistracted, disinherited?\\nMy spirit sinks in hopeless pain\\nWhen my fond glances yearn in vain\\nFor that dear face with whose bright eye\\nThe worshipped lotus scarce can vie.\\nAh when, my brother, shall I hear\\nThat voice that rang so soft and clear,\\nWhen, sweetly smiling as she spoke,\\nFrom her dear lips gay laughter broke?\\nWhen worn with toil and love I strayed\\nWith SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ through the forest shade,\\nNo trace of grief was seen in her,\\nMy kind and thoughtful comforter.\\nHow

lament;\\nAnd with wise counsel Lakshmaá¹\\x87 tried\\nTo soothe his care, and thus replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO best of men, thy grief oppose,\\nNor sink beneath thy weight of woes.\\nNot thus despond the

restrain.\\nFor earth, though cooled by wandering streams,\\nLies scorched beneath the midday beams.\\nRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 his steps to hell may bend,\\nOr lower yet in flight descend;\\nBut be thou sure, O

dies.\\nThy heart with strength and courage stay,\\nAnd cast this weakling mood away.\\nOur fainting hopes in vain revive\\nUnless with firm resolve we strive.\\nThe zeal that fires the toilerâ\\x80\\x99s breast\\nMid earthly powers is first and best.\\nZeal every check and bar defies,\\nAnd wins at length the loftiest prize,\\nIn woe and danger, toil and care,\\nZeal never yields to

The Tokens.\\n\\n\\nWith joy that sprang from hope restored\\nTo RÃ¡ma spake the VÃ¡nar lord:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know, by wise HanÃºmÃ¡n taught,\\nWhy thou the lonely wood hast sought.\\nWhere with thy brother Lakshmaá¹\\x87 thou\\nHast sojourned, bound by hermit vow;\\nHave heard how SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, Janakâ\\x80\\x99s child,\\nWas stolen in the pathless wild,\\nHow by a roving RÃ¡kshas she\\nWeeping was reft from him and thee;\\nHow, bent on death, the giant slew\\nThe vulture king, her guardian true,\\nAnd gave thy widowed breast to know\\nA solitary mournerâ\\x80\\x99s woe.\\nBut soon, dear Prince, thy heart shall be\\nFrom every trace of sorrow free;\\nFor I thy darling will restore,\\nLost like the prize of holy lore.(558)\\nYea, though in heaven the lady dwell,\\nOr prisoned in the depths of hell,\\nMy friendly care her way shall track\\nAnd bring thy ransomed darling back.\\nLet this my promise soothe thy care,\\nNor doubt the words I truly swear.\\nSaints, fiends, and dwellers of the skies\\nShall find thy wife a bitter prize,\\nLike the rash child who rues too late\\nThe treacherous lure of poisoned cate.\\nNo longer, Prince, thy loss deplore:\\nThy darling wife will I restore.\\nâ\\x80\\x99Twas she I saw: my heart infers\\nThat shrinking form was doubtless hers,\\nWhich gaint RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87, fierce and dread,\\nBore swiftly through the clouds oâ\\x80\\x99erhead\\nStill writhing in his strict embrace\\nLike helpless queen of serpent race,(559)\\nAnd from her lips that sad voice came\\nShrieking thine own and Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s name.\\nHigh on a hill she saw me stand\\nWith comrades twain on either hand.\\nHer outer robe to earth she threw,\\nAnd with it sent her anklets too.\\nWe saw the glittering tokens fall,\\nWe found them there and kept them all.\\nThese will I bring: perchance thine eyes\\nThe treasured spoils will recognize.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He ceased: then Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son replied\\nTo the glad tale, and eager cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBring them with all thy speed: delay\\nNo more, dear friend, but haste away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus RÃ¡ma spoke. SugrÃ\\xadva hied\\nWithin the mountainâ\\x80\\x99s caverned side,\\nImpelled by love that stirred each thought\\nThe precious tokens quickly brought,\\nAnd said to Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son: Behold\\nThis garment and these rings of gold.\\nIn RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s hand with friendly haste\\nThe jewels and the robe he placed.\\nThen, like the moon by mist assailed,\\nThe tear-dimmed eyes of RÃ¡ma failed;\\nThat burst of woe unmanned his frame,\\nWoe sprung from passion for his dame,\\nAnd with his manly strength oâ\\x80\\x99erthrown,\\nHe fell and cried, Ah me! mine own!\\nAgain, again close to his breast\\nThe ornaments and robe he pressed,\\nWhile the quick pants that shook his frame\\nAs from a furious serpent came.\\nOn his dear brother standing nigh\\nHe turned at length his piteous eye;\\nAnd, while his tears increasing ran,\\nIn bitter wail he thus began:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook, brother, and behold once more\\nThe ornaments and robe she wore,\\nDropped while the giant bore away\\nIn cruel arras his struggling prey,\\nDropped in some quiet spot, I ween,\\nWhere the young grass was soft and green;\\nFor still untouched by spot or stain\\nTheir former beauty all retain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He spoke with many a tear and sigh,\\nAnd thus his brother made reply:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe bracelets thou hast fondly shown,\\nAnd earrings, are to me unknown,\\nBut by long service taught I greet\\nThe anklets of her honoured feet.â\\x80\\x9d(560)\\n\\n  Then to SugrÃ\\xadva RÃ¡ma, best\\nOf Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s sons, these words addressed:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cSay to what quarter of the sky\\nThe cruel fiend was seen to fly,\\nBearing afar my captured wife,\\nMy darling dearer than my life.\\nSpeak, VÃ¡nar King, that I may know\\nWhere dwells the cause of all my woe;\\nThe fiend for whose transgression all\\nThe giants by this hand shall fall.\\nHe who the Maithil lady stole\\nAnd kindled fury in my soul,\\nHas sought his fate in senseless pride\\nAnd opened Deathâ\\x80\\x99s dark portal wide.\\nThen tell me, VÃ¡nar lord, I pray,\\n  The dwelling of my foe,\\nAnd he, beneath this hand, to-day\\n  To YÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s halls shall go.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto VII. RÃ¡ma Consoled.\\n\\n\\nWith longing love and woe oppressed\\nThe VÃ¡nar chief he thus addressed:\\nAnd he, while sobs his utterance broke,\\nRaised up his reverent hands and spoke:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cO Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, I cannot tell\\nWhere now that cruel fiend may dwell,\\nDeclare his power and might, or trace\\nThe author of his cursed race.\\nStill trust the promise that I make\\nAnd let thy breast no longer ache.\\nSo will I toil, nor toil in vain,\\nThat thou thy consort mayst regain.\\nSo will I work with might and skill\\nThat joy anew thy heart shall fill:\\nThe valour of my soul display,\\nAnd RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 and his legions slay.\\nAwake, awake! unmanned no more\\nRecall the strength was thine of yore.\\nBeseems not men like thee to wear\\nA weak heart yielding to despair.\\nLike troubles, too, mine eyes have seen,\\nLamenting for a long-lost queen;\\nBut, by despair unconquered yet,\\nMy strength of mind I neâ\\x80\\x99er forget.\\nFar more shouldst thou of lofty soul\\nThy passion and thy tears control,\\nWhen I, of VÃ¡narâ\\x80\\x99s humbler strain,\\nWeep not for her in ceaseless pain.\\nBe firm, be patient, nor forget\\nThe bounds the brave of heart have set\\nIn loss, in woe, in strife, in fear,\\nWhen the dark hour of death is near.\\nUp! with thine own brave heart advise:\\nNot thus despond the firm and wise.\\nBut he who gives his childish heart\\nTo choose the cowardâ\\x80\\x99s weakling part,\\nSinks, like a foundered vessel, deep\\nIn waves of woe that oâ\\x80\\x99er him sweep.\\nSee, suppliant hand to hand I lay,\\nAnd, moved by faithful love, I pray.\\nGive way no more to grief and gloom,\\nBut all thy native strength resume.\\nNo joy on earth, I ween, have they\\nWho yield their souls to sorrowâ\\x80\\x99s sway.\\nTheir glory fades in slow decline:\\nâ\\x80\\x99Tis not for thee to grieve and pine.\\nI do but hint with friendly speech\\nThe wiser part I dare not teach.\\nThis better path, dear friend, pursue,\\nAnd let not grief thy soul subdue.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  SugrÃ\\xadva thus with gentle art\\nAnd sweet words soothed the mournerâ\\x80\\x99s heart,\\nWho brushed off with his mantleâ\\x80\\x99s hem\\nTears from the eyes bedewed with them.\\nSugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s words were not in vain,\\nAnd RÃ¡ma was himself again,\\nAround the king his arms he threw\\nAnd thus began his speech anew:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cWhateâ\\x80\\x99er a friend most wise and true,\\nWho counsels for the best, should do,\\nWhateâ\\x80\\x99er his gentle part should be,\\nHas been performed, dear friend, by thee.\\nTaught by thy counsel, O my lord,\\nI feel my native strength restored.\\nA friend like thee is hard to gain,\\nMost rare in time of grief and pain.\\nNow strain thine utmost power to trace\\nThe Maithil ladyâ\\x80\\x99s dwelling place,\\nAnd aid me in my search to find\\nFierce RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 of the impious mind.\\nTrust thou, in turn, thy loyal friend,\\nAnd say what aid this arm can lend\\nTo speed thy hopes, as fostering rain\\nQuickens in earth the scattered grain.\\nDeem not those words, that seemed to spring\\nFrom pride, are false, O VÃ¡nar King.\\nNone from these lips has ever heard,\\nNone eâ\\x80\\x99er shall hear, one lying word.\\nAgain I promise and declare,\\nYea, by my truth, dear friend, I swear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then glad was King SugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s breast,\\nAnd all his lords their joy confessed,\\nStirred by sure hope of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s aid,\\nAnd promise which the prince had made.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto VIII. RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s Promise.\\n\\n\\nDoubt from SugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s heart had fled,\\nAnd thus to Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son he said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo bliss the Gods of heaven deny.\\nEach views me with

glorious son.\\nThou too in ripening time shall see\\nThy friend not all unworthy thee.\\nWhat gifts I have shall thus be shown:\\nNot mine the tongue to make them known.\\nStrong is the changeless bond that binds\\nThe friendly faith of noble minds,\\nIn woe, in danger, firm and sure\\nTheir constancy and love endure.\\nGold, silver, jewels rich and rare\\nThey count as wealth for friends to share.\\nYea, be they rich or poor and low,\\nBlest with all joys or sunk in woe,\\nStained with each fault or pure of blame,\\nTheir friends the nearest place may claim;\\nFor whom they leave, at friendshipâ\\x80\\x99s call,\\nTheir gold, their bliss, their homes and all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He spoke by generous impulse moved,\\nAnd Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son his speech approved\\nGlancing at Lakshmaá¹\\x87 by his side,\\nLike Indra in his beautyâ\\x80\\x99s pride.\\nThe VÃ¡nar monarch saw the pair\\nOf mighty brothers standing there,\\nAnd turned his rapid eye to view\\nThe forest trees that near him grew.\\nHe saw, not far from where he stood,\\nA SÃ¡l tree towering oâ\\x80\\x99er the wood.\\nAmid the thick leaves many a bee\\nGraced the scant blossoms of the tree,\\nFrom whose dark shade a bough, that bore\\nA load of leafy twigs, he tore,\\nWhich on the grassy ground he laid\\nAnd seats for him and RÃ¡ma made.\\nHanÃºmÃ¡n saw them sit, he sought\\nA SÃ¡l treeâ\\x80\\x99s leafy bough and brought\\nThe burthen, and with meek request\\nEntreated Lakshmaá¹\\x87, too, to rest.\\nThere on the noble mountainâ\\x80\\x99s brow,\\nStrewn with the young leaves of the bough,\\nSat Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son in placid ease\\nCalm as the sea when sleeps the breeze.\\nSugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s heart with rapture swelled,\\nAnd thus, by eager love impelled,\\nHe spoke in gracious tone,

me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He spoke, and RÃ¡ma, just and brave,\\nWhose pious soul to virtue clave,\\nSmiled as in conscious might he eyed\\nThe king of VÃ¡nars, and replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBest fruit of friendship is the deed\\nThat helps the friend in hour of need;\\nAnd this mine arm in death shall lay\\nThy robber ere the close of day.\\nFor see, these feathered darts of mine\\nWhose points so fiercely flash and shine,\\nAnd shafts with golden emblem, came\\nFrom dark woods known by Skandaâ\\x80\\x99s name,(561)\\nWinged from the pinion of the hern\\nLike Indraâ\\x80\\x99s bolts they strike and burn.\\nWith even knots and piercing head\\nEach like a furious snake is sped;\\nWith these, to-day, before thine eye\\nShall, like a shattered mountain, lie\\nBÃ¡li, thy dread and wicked foe,\\nOâ\\x80\\x99erwhelmed in hideous overthrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He spoke: SugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s bosom swelled\\nWith hope and joy unparalleled.\\nThen his glad voice the VÃ¡nar raised,\\nAnd thus the son of Raghu praised:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLong have I pined in depth of grief;\\nThou art the hope of all, O chief.\\nNow, Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, I hail thee friend,\\nAnd bid thee to my woes attend;\\nFor, by my truth I swear it, now\\nNot life itself is dear as thou,\\nSince by the witness fire we met\\nAnd friendly hand in hand was set.\\nFriend communes now with friend, and hence\\nI tell with surest confidence,\\nHow woes that on my spirit weigh\\nConsume me through the night and day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  For sobs and sighs he scarce could speak,\\nAnd his sad voice came low and weak,\\nAs, while his eyes with tears oâ\\x80\\x99erflowed,\\nThe burden of his soul he showed.\\nThen by strong effort, bravely made,\\nThe torrent of his tears he stayed,\\nWiped his bright eyes, his grief subdued,\\nAnd thus, more calm, his speech renewed:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cBy BÃ¡liâ\\x80\\x99s conquering might oppressed,\\nOf power and kingship dispossessed,\\nLoaded with taunts of scorn and hate\\nI left my realm and royal state.\\nHe tore away my consort: she\\nWas dearer than my life to me,\\nAnd many a friend to me and mine\\nIn hopeless chains was doomed to pine.\\nWith wicked thoughts, unsated still,\\nMe whom he wrongs he yearns to kill;\\nAnd spies of VÃ¡nar race, who tried\\nTo slay me, by this hand have died.\\nMoved by this constant doubt and fear\\nI saw thee, Prince, and came not near.\\nWhen woe and peril gather round\\nA foe in every form is found.\\nSave HanumÃ¡n, O Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son,\\nAnd these, no friend is left me, none.\\nThrough their kind

and pain,\\nMy wretched life I still sustain.\\nEnough, for thou hast heard in brief\\nThe story of my pain and grief.\\nHis mighty strength all regions know,\\nMy brother, but my deadly foe.\\nAh, if the proud oppressor fell,\\nHis death would all my woe dispel.\\nYea, on my cruel conquerorâ\\x80\\x99s fall\\nMy joy depends, my life, my all.\\nThis were the end and sure relief,\\nO RÃ¡ma, of my tale of grief.\\nFair be his lot or dark with woe,\\nNo comfort like a friend I know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then RÃ¡ma spoke: â\\x80\\x9cO friend, relate\\nWhence sprang fraternal strife and hate,\\nThat

scorn\\nAnd bitter woe thou long hast borne,\\nMy soul indignant swells with pain\\nLike waters flushed with furious rain.\\nThen, ere I string this bended bow,\\nTell me the tale I long to know,\\nEre from the cord my arrow fly,\\nAnd low in death thy foeman lie.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He spoke: SugrÃ\\xadva joyed to hear,\\nNor less his lords were glad of cheer:\\nAnd thus to RÃ¡ma

Dundubhi.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI doubt not, Prince, thy peerless might,\\nArmed with these shafts so keen and bright,\\nLike all-destroying fires of fate,\\nThe worlds could burn and devastate.\\nBut lend thou first thy mind and ear\\nOf BÃ¡liâ\\x80\\x99s power and might to hear.\\nHow bold, how firm, in battle tried,\\nIs BÃ¡liâ\\x80\\x99s heart; and then decide.\\nFrom east to west, from south to north\\nOn restless errand hurrying forth,\\nFrom farthest sea to sea he flies\\nBefore the sun has lit the skies.\\nA mountain top he oft will seek,\\nTear from its root a towering peak,\\nHurl it aloft, as â\\x80\\x99twere a ball,\\nAnd catch it ere to earth it fall.\\nAnd many a tree that long has stood\\nIn health and vigour in the wood,\\nHis single arm to earth will throw,\\nThe marvels of his might to show.\\nShaped like a bull, a monster bore\\nThe name of Dundubhi of yore:\\nHe matched in size a mountain height,\\nA thousand elephants in might.\\nBy pride of wondrous gifts impelled,\\nAnd strength he deemed unparalleled,\\nTo Ocean, lord of stream and brook,\\nAthirst for war, his way he took.\\nHe reached the king of rolling waves\\nWhose gems are piled in sunless caves,\\nAnd threw his challenge to the sea;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome forth, O King, and fight with me.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe spoke, and from his ocean bed\\nThe righteous(567) monarch heaved his head,\\nAnd gave, sedate, his calm reply\\nTo him whom fate impelled to die:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot mine, not mine the power,â\\x80\\x9d he cried,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo cope with thee in battle tried;\\nBut listen to my voice, and seek\\nThe worthier foe of whom I speak.\\nThe Lord of Hills, where hermits live\\nAnd love the home his forests give,\\nWhose child is Å\\x9aankarâ\\x80\\x99s darling queen,(568)\\nThe King of Snows is he I mean.\\nDeep caves has he, and dark boughs shade\\nThe torrent and the wild cascade.\\nFrom him expect the fierce delight\\nWhich heroes feel in equal fight.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He deemed that fear checked oceanâ\\x80\\x99s king,\\nAnd, like an arrow from the string,\\nTo the wild woods that clothe the side\\nOf Lord HimÃ¡layaâ\\x80\\x99s hills he hied.\\nThen Dundubhi, with hideous roar,\\nHuge fragments from the summit tore\\nVast as AirÃ¡vat,(569) white with snow,\\nAnd hurled them to the plains below.\\nThen like a white cloud soft, serene,\\nThe Lord of Mountainsâ\\x80\\x99 form was seen.\\nIt sat upon a lofty crest,\\nAnd thus the furious fiend addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBeseems thee not, O virtueâ\\x80\\x99s friend,\\nMy mountain tops to rive and rend;\\nFor I, the hermitâ\\x80\\x99s calm retreat,\\nFor deeds of war am all unmeet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The demonâ\\x80\\x99s eye with rage grew red,\\nAnd thus in furious tone he said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf thou from fear or sloth decline\\nTo match thy strength in war with mine,\\nWhere shall I find a champion, say,\\nTo meet me burning for the fray?â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe spoke: HimÃ¡laya, skilled in lore\\nOf eloquence, replied once more,\\nAnd, angered in his righteous mind,\\nAddressed the chief of demon kind:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe VÃ¡nar BÃ¡li, brave and wise,\\nSon of the God who rules the skies,(570)\\nSways, glorious in his high renown,\\nKishkindhÃ¡ his imperial town.\\nWell may that valiant lord who knows\\nEach art of war his might oppose\\nTo thine, in equal battle set,\\nAs Namuehi(571) and Indra met.\\nGo, if thy soul desire the fray;\\nTo BÃ¡liâ\\x80\\x99s city speed away,\\nAnd that unconquered hero meet\\nWhose fame is high for warlike feat.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe listened to the Lord of Snow,\\nAnd, his proud heart with rage aglow,\\nSped swift away and lighted down\\nBy vast KishkindhÃ¡, BÃ¡liâ\\x80\\x99s town.\\nWith pointed horns to strike and gore\\nThe semblance of a bull he bore,\\nHuge as a cloud that downward bends\\nEre the full flood of rain descends.\\nImpelled by pride and rage and hate,\\nHe thundered at KishkindhÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s gate;\\nAnd with his bellowing, like the sound\\nOf pealing drums, he shook the ground,\\nHe rent the earth and prostrate threw\\nThe trees that near the portal grew.\\nKing BÃ¡li from the bowers within\\nIndignant heard the roar and din.\\nThen, moonlike mid the stars, with all\\nHis dames he hurried to the wall;\\nAnd to the fiend this speech, expressed\\nIn clear and measured words, addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKnow me for monarch. BÃ¡li styled,\\nOf VÃ¡nar tribes that roam the wild.\\nSay why dost thou this gate molest,\\nAnd bellowing thus disturb our rest?\\nI know thee, mighty fiend: beware\\nAnd guard thy life with wiser care.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe spoke: and thus the fiend returned,\\nWhile red with rage his eyeballs burned:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! speak when all thy dames are nigh\\nAnd hero-like thy foe defy?\\nCome, meet me in the fight this day,\\nAnd learn my strength by bold assay.\\nOr shall I spare thee, and relent\\nUntil the coming night be spent?\\nTake then the respite of a night\\nAnd yield thee to each soft delight.\\nThen, monarch of the VÃ¡nar race\\nWith loving arms thy friends embrace.\\nGifts on thy faithful lords bestow,\\nBid each and all farewell, and go.\\nShow in the streets once more thy face,\\nInstall thy son to fill thy place.\\nDally a while with each dear dame;\\nAnd then my strength thy pride shall tame\\nFor, should I smite thee drunk with wine\\nEnamoured of those dames of thine,\\nBeneath diseases bowed and bent,\\nOr weak, unarmed, or negligent,\\nMy deed would merit hate and scorn\\nAs his who slays the child unborn.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen BÃ¡liâ\\x80\\x99s soul with rage was fired,\\nQueen TÃ¡ra and the dames retired;\\nAnd slowly, with a laugh of pride,\\nThe king of VÃ¡nars thus replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMe, fiend, thou deemest drunk with wine:\\nUnless thy fear the fight decline,\\nCome, meet me in the fray, and test\\nThe spirit of my valiant breast.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe spoke in wrath and high disdain;\\nAnd, laying down his golden chain,\\nGift of his sire Mahendra, dared\\nThe demon, for the fray prepared;\\nSeized by the horns the monster, vast\\nAs a huge hill, and held him fast,\\nThen fiercely dragged him round and round,\\nAnd, shouting, hurled him to the ground.\\nBlood streaming from his ears, he rose,\\nAnd wild with fury strove the foes.\\nThen BÃ¡li, match for Indraâ\\x80\\x99s might,\\nWith every arm renewed the fight.\\nHe fought with fists, and feet, and knees,\\nWith fragments of the rock, and trees.\\nAt last the monsterâ\\x80\\x99s strength, assailed\\nBy Å\\x9aakraâ\\x80\\x99s(572) conquering offspring, failed.\\nHim BÃ¡li raised with mighty strain\\nAnd dashed upon the ground again;\\nWhere, bruised and shattered, in a tide\\nOf rushing blood, the demon died.\\nKing BÃ¡li saw the lifeless corse,\\nAnd bending, with tremendous force\\nRaised the huge bulk from where it lay,\\nAnd hurled it full a league away.\\nAs through the air the body flew,\\nSome blood-drops, caught by gales that blew,\\nWelled from his shattered jaw and fell\\nBy Saint Matangaâ\\x80\\x99s hermit cell:\\nMatanga saw, illustrious sage,\\nThose drops defile his hermitage,\\nAnd, as he marvelled whence they came,\\nFierce anger filled his soul with flame:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho is the villain, evil-souled,\\nWith childish thoughts unwise and bold,\\nWho is the impious wretch,â\\x80\\x9d he cried,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy whom my grove with blood is dyed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus spoke Matanga in his rage,\\nAnd hastened from the hermitage,\\nWhen lo, before his wondering eyes\\nLay the dead bull of mountain size.\\nHis hermit soul was nothing slow\\nThe doer of the deed to know,\\nAnd thus the VÃ¡nar in a burst\\nOf wild tempestuous wrath he cursed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNeâ\\x80\\x99er let that VÃ¡nar wander here,\\nFor, if he come, his death is near,\\nWhose impious hand with blood has dyed\\nThe holy place where I abide,\\nWho threw this demon corse and made\\nA ruin of the pleasant shade.\\nIf eâ\\x80\\x99er he plant his wicked feet\\nWithin one league of my retreat;\\nYea, if the villain come so nigh\\nThat very hour he needs must die.\\nAnd let the VÃ¡nar lords who dwell\\nIn the dark woods that skirt my cell\\nObey my words, and speeding hence\\nFind them some meeter residence.\\nHere if they dare to stay, on all\\nThe terrors of my curse shall fall.\\nThey spoil the tender saplings, dear\\nAs children which I cherish here,\\nMar root and branch and leaf and spray,\\nAnd steal the ripening fruit away.\\nOne day I grant, no further hour,\\nTo-morrow shall my curse have power,\\nAnd then each VÃ¡nar I may see\\nA stone through countless years shall be.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThe VÃ¡nars heard the curse and hied\\nFrom sheltering wood and mountain side.\\nKing BÃ¡li marked their haste and dread,\\nAnd to the flying leaders said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak, VÃ¡nar chiefs, and tell me why\\nFrom Saint Matangaâ\\x80\\x99s grove ye fly\\nTo gather round me: is it well\\nWith all who in those woodlands dwell?â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe spoke: the VÃ¡nar leaders told\\nKing BÃ¡li with his chain of gold\\nWhat curse the saint had on them laid,\\nWhich drove them from their ancient shade.\\nThen royal BÃ¡li sought the sage,\\nWith reverent hands to soothe his rage.\\nThe holy man his suppliant spurned,\\nAnd to his cell in anger turned.\\nThat curse on BÃ¡li sorely pressed,\\nAnd long his conscious soul distressed.\\nHim still the curse and terror keep\\nAfar from RishyamÃºkaâ\\x80\\x99s steep.\\nHe dares not to the grove draw nigh,\\nNay scarce will hither turn his eye.\\nWe know what terrors warm him hence,\\nAnd roam these woods in confidence.\\nLook, Prince, before thee white and dry\\nThe demonâ\\x80\\x99s bones uncovered lie,\\nWho, like a hill in bulk and length,\\nFell ruind for his pride of strength.\\nSee those high SÃ¡l trees seven in row\\nThat droop their mighty branches low,\\nThese at one grasp would BÃ¡li seize,\\nAnd leafless shake the trembling trees.\\nThese tales I tell, O Prince, to show\\nThe matchless power that arms the foe.\\nHow canst thou hope to slay him? how\\nMeet BÃ¡li in the battle now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  SugrÃ\\xadva spoke and sadly sighed:\\nAnd Lakshmaá¹\\x87 with a laugh replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat show of power, what proof and test\\nMay still the doubts that fill thy breast?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He spoke. SugrÃ\\xadva thus replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee yonder SÃ¡l trees side by side.\\nKing BÃ¡li here would take his stand\\nGrasping his bow with vigorous hand,\\nAnd every arrow, keen and true,\\nWould strike its tree and pierce it through.\\nIf RÃ¡ma now his bow will bend,\\nAnd through one trunk an arrow send;\\nOr if his arm can raise and throw\\nTwo hundred measures of his bow,\\nGrasped by a foot and hurled through air,\\nThe demon bull that moulders there,\\nMy heart will own his might and fain\\nBelieve my foe already slain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  SugrÃ\\xadva spoke inflamed with ire,\\nScanned RÃ¡ma with a glance of fire,\\nPondered a while in silent mood.\\nAnd thus again his speech renewed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll lands with BÃ¡liâ\\x80\\x99s glories ring,\\nA valiant, strong, and mighty king;\\nIn conscious power unused to yield,\\nA hero first in every field.\\nHis wondrous deeds his might declare,\\nDeeds Gods might scarcely do or dare;\\nAnd on this power reflecting still\\nI roam on RishyamÃºkaâ\\x80\\x99s hill.\\nAwed by my brotherâ\\x80\\x99s might I rove,\\nIn doubt and fear, from grove to grove,\\nWhile HanumÃ¡n, my chosen friend,\\nAnd faithful lords my steps attend;\\nAnd now, O true to friendshipâ\\x80\\x99s tie,\\nI hail in thee my best ally.\\nMy surest refuge from my foes,\\nAnd steadfast as the Lord of Snows.\\nStill, when I muse how strong and bold\\nIs cruel BÃ¡li, evil-souled,\\nBut neâ\\x80\\x99er, O chief of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s line,\\nHave seen what strength in war is thine,\\nThough in my heart I may not dare\\nDoubt thy great might, despise, compare,\\nThoughts of his fearful deeds will rise\\nAnd fill my soul with sad surmise.\\nSpeech, form, and trust which naught may move\\nThy secret strength and glory prove,\\nAs smouldering ashes dimly show\\nThe dormant fires that live below.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He ceased: and RÃ¡ma answered, while\\nPlayed oâ\\x80\\x99er his lips a gracious smile:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot yet convinced? This clear assay\\nShall drive each lingering doubt away.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThus RÃ¡ma spoke his heart to cheer,\\nTo Dundubhiâ\\x80\\x99s vast frame drew near:\\nHe touched it with his foot in play\\nAnd sent it twenty leagues away.\\nSugrÃ\\xadva marked what easy force\\nHurled through the air that demonâ\\x80\\x99s corse\\nWhose mighty bones were white and dried,\\nAnd to the son of Raghu cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy brother BÃ¡li, when his might\\nWas drunk and weary from the fight,\\nHurled forth the monster body, fresh\\nWith skin and sinews, blood and flesh.\\nNow flesh and blood are dried away,\\nThe crumbling bones are light as hay,\\nWhich thou, O Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, hast sent\\nFlying through air in merriment.\\nThis test alone is weak to show\\nIf thou be stronger or the foe.\\nBy thee a heap of mouldering bone,\\nBy him the recent corse was thrown.\\nThy strength, O Prince, is yet untried:\\nCome, pierce one tree: let this decide.\\nPrepare thy ponderous bow and bring\\nClose to thine ear the straining string.\\nOn yonder SÃ¡l tree fix thine eye,\\nAnd let the mighty arrow fly,\\nI doubt not, chief, that I shall see\\nThy pointed shaft transfix the tree.\\nThen come, assay the easy task,\\nAnd do for love the thing I ask.\\n  Best of all lights, the Day-God fills\\n    With glory earth and sky:\\n  HimÃ¡laya is the lord of hills\\n    That heave their heads on high.\\n  The royal lion is the best\\n    Of beasts that tread the earth;\\n  And thou, O hero, art confessed\\n    First in heroic worth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto XII. The Palm Trees.\\n\\n\\nThen RÃ¡ma, that his friend might know\\nHis strength unrivalled, grasped his bow,\\nThat mighty bow the foeâ\\x80\\x99s dismay,â\\x80\\x94\\nAnd on the string an arrow lay.\\nNext on the tree his eye he bent,\\nAnd forth the hurtling weapon went.\\nLoosed from the matchless heroâ\\x80\\x99s hold,\\nThat arrow, decked with burning gold,\\nCleft the seven palms in line, and through\\nThe hill that rose behind them flew:\\nSix subterranean realms it passed,\\nAnd reached the lowest depth at last,\\nWhence speeding back through earth and air\\nIt sought the quiver, and rested there.(573)\\nUpon the cloven trees amazed,\\nThe sovereign of the VÃ¡nars gazed.\\nWith all his chains and gold outspread\\nProstrate on earth he laid his head.\\nThen, rising, palm to palm he laid\\nIn reverent act, obeisance made,\\nAnd joyously to RÃ¡ma, best\\nOf war-trained chiefs, these words addressed:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cWhat champion, Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, may hope\\nWith thee in deadly fight to cope,\\nWhose arrow, leaping from the bow,\\nCleaves tree and hill and earth below?\\nScarce might the Gods, arrayed for strife\\nBy Indraâ\\x80\\x99s self, escape, with life\\nAssailed by thy victorious hand:\\nAnd how may BÃ¡li hope to stand?\\nAll grief and care are past away,\\nAnd joyous thoughts my bosom sway,\\nWho have in thee a friend, renowned,\\nAs Varuá¹\\x87(574) or as Indra, found.\\nThen on! subdue,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99tis friendshipâ\\x80\\x99s claim,â\\x80\\x94\\nMy foe who bears a brotherâ\\x80\\x99s name.\\nStrike BÃ¡li down beneath thy feet:\\nWith suppliant hands I thus entreat.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSugrÃ\\xadva ceased, and RÃ¡ma pressed\\nThe grateful VÃ¡nar to his breast;\\nAnd thoughts of kindred feeling woke\\nIn Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s bosom, as he spoke:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn to KishkindhÃ¡, on with speed!\\nThou, VÃ¡nar King, our way shalt lead,\\nThen challenge BÃ¡li forth to fight.\\nThy foe who scorns a brotherâ\\x80\\x99s right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  They sought KishkindhÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s gate and stood\\nConcealed by trees in densest wood,\\nSugrÃ\\xadva, to the fight addressed,\\nMore closely drew his cinctured vest,\\nAnd raised a wild sky-piercing shout\\nTo call the foeman BÃ¡li out.\\n\\n  Forth came impetuous BÃ¡li, stirred\\nTo fury by the shout he heard.\\nSo the great sun, ere night has ceased,\\nSprings up impatient to the east.\\nThen fierce and wild the conflict raged\\nAs hand to hand the foes engaged,\\nAs though in battle mid the stars\\nFought Mercury and fiery Mars.(575)\\nTo highest pitch of frenzy wrought\\nWith fists like thunderbolts they fought,\\nWhile near them RÃ¡ma took his stand,\\nAnd viewed the battle, bow in hand.\\nAlike they stood in form and might,\\nLike heavenly AÅ\\x9bvins(576) paired in fight,\\nNor might the son of Raghu know\\nWhere fought the friend and where the foe;\\nSo, while his bow was ready bent,\\nNo life-destroying shaft he sent.\\nCrushed down by BÃ¡liâ\\x80\\x99s mightier stroke\\nSugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s force now sank and broke,\\nWho, hoping naught from RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s aid,\\nTo RishyamÃºka fled dismayed,\\nWeary, and faint, and wounded sore,\\nHis body bruised and dyed with gore,\\nFrom BÃ¡liâ\\x80\\x99s blows, in rage and dread,\\nAfar to sheltering woods he fled.\\n\\n  Nor BÃ¡li farther dared pursue,\\nThe curbing curse too well he knew.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFled from thy death!â\\x80\\x9d the victor cried,\\nAnd home the mighty warrior hied.\\nHanÃºmÃ¡n, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son\\nBeheld the conquered VÃ¡nar run,\\nAnd followed to the sheltering shade\\nWhere yet SugrÃ\\xadva stood dismayed.\\nNear and more near the chieftains came,\\nThen, for intolerable shame,\\nNot daring yet to lift his eyes,\\nSugrÃ\\xadva spoke with burning sighs:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThy matchless strength I first beheld,\\nAnd dared my foe, by thee impelled.\\nWhy hast thou tried me with deceit\\nAnd urged me to a sure defeat?\\nThou shouldst have said, â\\x80\\x9cI will not slay\\nThy foeman in the coming fray.â\\x80\\x9d\\nFor had I then thy purpose known\\nI had not waged the fight alone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The VÃ¡nar sovereign, lofty-souled,\\nIn plaintive voice his sorrows told.\\nThen RÃ¡ma spake: â\\x80\\x9cSugrÃ\\xadva, list,\\nAll anger from thy heart dismissed,\\nAnd I will tell the cause that stayed\\nMine arrow, and withheld the aid.\\nIn dress, adornment, port, and height,\\nIn splendour, battle-shout, and might,\\nNo shade of difference could I see\\nBetween thy foe, O King, and thee.\\nSo like was each, I stood at gaze,\\nMy senses lost in wildering maze,\\nNor loosened from my straining bow\\nA deadly arrow at the foe,\\nLest in my doubt the shaft should send\\nTo sudden death our surest friend.\\nO, if this hand in heedless guilt\\nAnd rash resolve thy blood had spilt,\\nThrough every land, O VÃ¡nar King,\\nMy wild and foolish act would ring.\\nSore weight of sin on him must lie\\nBy whom a friend is made to die;\\nAnd Lakshmaá¹\\x87, I, and SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, best\\nOf dames, on thy protection rest.\\nOn, warrior!

with death a devotee\\nWhen he had stooped to sin like thee;\\nAnd many a king in ancient time\\nHas punished frantic sinnersâ\\x80\\x99 crime,\\nAnd, when their impious blood was spilt,\\nHas washed away the stain of guilt.\\nCease, BÃ¡li, cease: no more complain:\\nReproaches and laments are vain,\\nFor thou art justly punished: we\\nObey our king and are not free.\\nOnce more, O BÃ¡li, lend

game,\\nAt stately stags our shafts we aim.\\nWe strike them bounding scared away,\\nWe strike them as they stand at bay,\\nWhen careless in the shade they lie,\\nOr scan the plain with watchful eye.\\nThey turn away their heads; we aim,\\nAnd none the eager hunter blame.\\nEach royal saint, well trained in law\\nOf duty, loves his bow to draw\\nAnd strike the quarry, eâ\\x80\\x99en as

bestow\\nFruit of pure life and virtuous deed,\\nAnd lofty dutyâ\\x80\\x99s hard-won meed.\\nHarm not thy lord the king: abstain\\nFrom act and word that cause him pain;\\nFor kings are children of the skies\\nWho walk this earth in menâ\\x80\\x99s disguise.\\nBut thou, in dutyâ\\x80\\x99s claims untaught,\\nThy breast with blinding passion fraught,\\nAssailest me who still have clung\\nTo duty, with thy bitter tongue.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He ceased: and BÃ¡li sore distressed\\nThe sovereign claims of law confessed,\\nAnd freed, oâ\\x80\\x99erwhelmed with woe and shame,\\nThe lord of

reproachesâ\\x80\\x99 idle sting.\\nThou, in the truth by trial trained,\\nBest knowledge of the right hast gained:\\nAnd layest, just and pure within,\\nThe meetest penalty on sin.\\nThrough every bond of law I burst,\\nThe boldest sinner and the worst.\\nO let thy right-instructing speech\\nConsole my heart and wisely teach.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Like some sad elephant who stands\\nFast sinking in the treacherous sands,\\nThus BÃ¡li raised despairing eyes;\\nThen spake again with sobs and sighs:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cNot for myself, O King, I grieve,\\nFor TÃ¡rÃ¡ or the friends I leave,\\nAs for

the life to come have bliss;\\nFor each has done his task in this.\\nThou, wandering from the right, art made\\nPure by the forfeit thou hast paid.\\nThy weight of sins is cast aside,\\nAnd

abode.\\nSoon from the inner chambers came\\nThe VÃ¡nar of exalted fame;\\nAnd joyful friends drew near and shed\\nKing-making balm upon his head,\\nLike Gods anointing in the skies\\nTheir sovereign of the thousand eyes.(614)\\nThen brought they, oâ\\x80\\x99er their king to hold\\nThe white umbrella decked with gold,\\nAnd chouries with their waving hair\\nIn golden handles wondrous fair;\\nAnd fragrant herbs and seed and spice,\\nAnd sparkling gems exceeding price,\\nAnd every bloom from woods and leas,\\nAnd gum distilled from milky trees;\\nAnd precious ointment white as milk,\\nAnd spotless robes of cloth and silk,\\nWreaths of sweet flowers whose glories gleam\\nIn grassy grove, on lake or stream.\\nAnd fragrant sandal and each scent\\nThat makes the soft breeze redolent;\\nGrain, honey, odorous seed, and store\\nOf oil and curd and golden ore;\\nA noble tigerâ\\x80\\x99s skin, a pair\\nOf sandals wrought with costliest care,\\nEight pairs of damsels drawing nigh\\nBrought unguents stained with varied dye.\\nThen gems and cates and robes displayed\\nBefore the twice-born priests were laid,\\nThat they would deign in order due\\nTo consecrate the king anew.\\nThe sacred grass was duly spread\\nAnd sacrificial flame was fed,\\nWhich Scripture-learned priests supplied\\nWith oil which texts had sanctified.\\nThen, with all rites ordained of old,\\nHigh on the terrace bright with gold,\\nWhereon a glorious carpet lay,\\nAnd fresh-culled garlands sweet and gay,\\nPlaced on his throne, SugrÃ\\xadva bent\\nHis looks toward the Orient.\\nIn horns from forehead of the bull,\\nIn pitchers bright and beautiful,\\nIn urns of gold the VÃ¡nara took\\nPure water brought from stream and brook,\\nFrom every consecrated strand\\nAnd every sea that beats the land.\\nThen, as prescribed by sacred lore\\nAnd many a mighty sage of yore,(615)\\nThe leaders of the VÃ¡nars poured\\nThe sacred water on their lord.(616)\\nFrom every VÃ¡nar at the close\\nOf that imperial rite arose\\nShouts of glad triumph, loud and long\\nRepeated by the high-souled throng.\\nSugrÃ\\xadva, when the rite was done,\\nObeyed the hest of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son,\\nPrince Angad to his breast he strained,\\nAnd partner of his sway ordained.\\nOnce more from all the host rang out\\nThe loud huzza and jovful shout.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell done! well done!â\\x80\\x9d each VÃ¡nar cried,\\nAnd good SugrÃ\\xadva glorified.\\nThen with glad voices loudly raised\\nWere RÃ¡ma and his brother praised;\\nAnd bright KishkindhÃ¡ shone that day\\nWith happy

RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s Lament.\\n\\n\\nBut RÃ¡ma in the autumn night\\nStood musing on the mountain height,\\nWhile grief and love that scorned control\\nShook with wild storms the heroâ\\x80\\x99s soul.\\nClear was the sky, without a cloud\\nThe glory of the moon to shroud.\\nAnd bright with purest silver shone\\nEach hill the soft beams looked upon.\\nHe knew SugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s heart was bent\\nOn pleasure, gay and negligent.\\nHe thought on Janakâ\\x80\\x99s child forlorn\\nFrom his fond arms for ever torn.\\nHe mourned occasion slipping by,\\nAnd faint with anguish heaved each sigh.\\nHe sat where many a varied streak\\nOf rich ore marked the mountain peak.\\nHe raised his eyes the sky to view,\\nAnd to his love his sad thoughts flew.\\nHe heard the SÃ¡ras cry, and faint\\nWith sorrow poured his love-born plaint:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe, she who mocked the softest tone\\nOf wild birdsâ\\x80\\x99 voices with her own,â\\x80\\x94\\nWhere strays she now, my love who played\\nSo happy in our hermit shade?\\nHow can my absent love behold\\nThe bright trees with their flowers of gold,\\nAnd all their gleaming glory see\\nWith eyes that vainly look for me?\\nHow is it with my darling when\\nFrom the deep tangles of the glen\\nFloat carols of each bird elate\\nWith rapture singing to his mate?\\nIn vain my weary glances rove\\nFrom lake to hill, from stream to grove:\\nI find no rapture in the scene,\\nAnd languish for my fawn-eyed queen.\\nAh, does strong love with wild unrest,\\nBorn of the autumn, stir her breast?\\nAnd does the gentle lady pine\\nTill her bright eyes shall look in mine?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son in piteous tone,\\nOâ\\x80\\x99erwhelmed with sorrow, made his moan.\\nEâ\\x80\\x99en as the bird that drinks the rains(632)\\nTo Indra thousand-eyed complains.\\nThen Lakshmaá¹\\x87 who had wandered through\\nThe copses where the berries grew,\\nReturning to the cavern found\\nHis brother chief in sorrow drowned,\\nAnd pitying the woes that broke\\nThe spirit of the hero spoke:\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cWhy cast thy strength of soul away,\\nAnd weakly yield to passionâ\\x80\\x99s sway?\\nArise, my brother, do and dare\\nEre action perish in despair.\\nRecall the firmness of thy heart,\\nAnd nerve thee for a heroâ\\x80\\x99s part.\\nWhose is the hand unscathed to sieze\\nThe red flame quickened by the breeze?\\nWhere is the foe will dare to wrong\\nOr keep the Maithil lady long?â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen with pale lips that sorrow dried\\nThe son of Raghu thus replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLord Indra thousand-eyed, has sent\\nThe sweet rain from the firmament,\\nSees the rich promise of the grain,\\nAnd turns him to his rest again.\\nThe clouds with voices loud and deep,\\nVeiling each tree upon the steep,\\nUp on the thirsty earth have shed\\nTheir precious burden and are fled.\\nNow in kingsâ\\x80\\x99 hearts ambition glows:\\nThey rush to battle with their foes;(633)\\nBut in SugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s sloth I see\\nNo care for deeds of chivalry.\\nSee, Lakshmaá¹\\x87, on each breezy height\\nA thousand autumn blooms are bright.\\nSee how the wings of wild swans gleam\\nOn every islet of the stream.\\nFour months of flood and rain are past:\\nA hundred years they seemed to last\\nTo me whom toil and trouble tried,\\nMy SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ severed from my side.\\nShe, gentlest woman, weak and young,\\nStill to her lord unwearied clung.\\nStill by the exileâ\\x80\\x99s side she stood\\nIn the wild ways of Daá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dak wood,\\nLike a fond bird disconsolate\\nIf parted from her darling mate.\\nSugrÃ\\xadva, lapped in soft repose,\\nUntouched by pity for my woes,\\nScorns the poor exile, dispossessed,\\nBy RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s mightier arm oppressed,\\nThe wretch who comes to sue and pray\\nFrom his lost kingdom far away.\\nHence falls on me the VÃ¡narâ\\x80\\x99s scorn,\\nA suitor friendless and forlorn.\\nThe time is come: with heedless eye\\nHe sees the hour of action fly,â\\x80\\x94\\nUnmindful, now his hopes succeed,\\nOf promise made in stress of need.\\nGo seek him sunk in bliss and sloth,\\nForgetful of his royal oath,\\nAnd as mine envoy thus upbraid\\nThe monarch for his help delayed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVile is the wretch who will not pay\\nThe favour of an earlier day,\\nHope in the supplicantâ\\x80\\x99s breast awakes,\\nAnd then his plighted promise breaks.\\nNoblest, mid all of women born,\\nWho keeps the words his lips have sworn,\\nYea, if those words be good or ill,\\nMaintains his faith unbroken still.\\nThe thankless who forget to aid\\nThe friend who helped them when they prayed,\\nDishonoured in their death shall lie,\\nAnd dogs shall pass their corpses by.\\nSure thou wouldst see my strained arm hold\\nMy bow of battle backed with gold,\\nWouldst gaze upon its awful form\\nLike lightning flashing through the storm,\\nAnd hear the clanging bowstring loud\\nAs thunder from a labouring cloud.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  His valour and his strength I know:\\nBut pleasureâ\\x80\\x99s sway now sinks them low,\\nWith thee, my brother, for ally\\nThat strength and valour I defy.\\nHe promised, when the rains should end,\\nThe succour of his arm to lend.\\nThose months are past: he dares forget,\\nAnd, lapped in pleasure, slumbers yet.\\nNo thought disturbs his careless breast\\nFor us impatient and distressed,\\nAnd, while we sadly wait and pine,\\nGirt by his lords he quaffs the wine.\\nGo, brother, go, his palace seek,\\nAnd boldly to SugrÃ\\xadva speak,\\nThus give the listless king to know\\nWhat waits him if my anger glow:\\nStill open, to the gloomy God,\\nLies the sad path that BÃ¡li trod.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill to thy plighted word be true,\\nLest thou, O King, that path pursue.\\nI launched the shaft I pointed well.\\nAnd BÃ¡li, only BÃ¡li, fell.\\nBut, if from truth thou dare to stray,\\nBoth thee and thine this hand shall slay.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThus be the VÃ¡nar king addressed,\\nThen add thyself

Sea,(792)\\nWho now to RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s envoy shows\\nHigh honour for the debt he owes.\\nHe bade me lift my buried head\\nUprising from my watery bed,\\nAnd woo the VÃ¡nar chief to rest\\nA moment on my glittering crest.\\nRefresh thy weary limbs, and eat\\nMy mountain fruits for they are sweet.\\nI too, O chieftain, know thee well;\\nThree worlds thy famous virtues tell;\\nAnd none, I ween, with thee may vie\\nWho spring impetuous through the sky.\\nTo every guest, though mean and low.\\nThe wise respect and honour show;\\nAnd how shall I neglect thee, how\\nSlight the great guest so near me now?\\nSon of the Wind, â\\x80\\x99tis thine to share\\nThe might of him who shakes the air;\\nAnd,â\\x80\\x94for he loves his offspring,â\\x80\\x94he\\nIs honoured when I honour thee.\\nOf yore, when Kritaâ\\x80\\x99s age(793) was new,\\nThe little hills and mountains flew\\nWhereâ\\x80\\x99er they listed, borne on wings\\nMore rapid than the feathered kingâ\\x80\\x99s.(794)\\nBut mighty terror came on all\\nThe Gods and saints who feared their fall.\\nAnd Indra in his anger rent\\nTheir pinions with the bolts he sent.\\nWhen in his ruthless fury he\\nLevelled his flashing bolt at me,\\nThe great-souled Wind inclined to save,\\nAnd laid me neath the oceanâ\\x80\\x99s wave.\\nThus by the favour of the sire\\nI kept my cherished wings entire;\\nAnd for this deed of kindness done\\nI honour thee his noble son.\\nO come, thy weary limbs relieve,\\nAnd honour due from me receive.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI may not rest,â\\x80\\x9d the VÃ¡nar cried;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must not stay or turn aside.\\nYet pleased am I, thou noblest hill,\\nAnd as the deed accept thy will.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus as he spoke he lightly pressed\\nWith his broad hand the mountainâ\\x80\\x99s crest,\\nThen bounded upward to the height\\nOf heaven, rejoicing in his might,\\nAnd through the fields of boundless blue,\\nThe pathway of his father, flew.\\nGods, saints, and heavenly bards beheld\\nThat flight that none had paralleled,\\nThen to the NÃ¡gasâ\\x80\\x99 mother(795) came\\nAnd thus addressed the sun-bright dame:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee, HanumÃ¡n with venturous leap\\nWould spring across the mighty deep,â\\x80\\x94\\nA VÃ¡nar prince, the Wind-Godâ\\x80\\x99s seed:\\nCome, SurasÃ¡, his course impede.\\nIn RÃ¡kshas form thy shape disguise,\\nTerrific, like a hill in size:\\nLet thy red eyes with fury glow,\\nAnd high as heaven thy body grow.\\nWith fearful tusks the chief defy,\\nThat we his power and strength may try.\\nHe will with guile thy hold elude,\\nOr own thy might, by thee subdued.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Pleased with the grateful honours paid,\\nThe godlike dame their words obeyed,\\nClad in a shape of terror she\\nSprang from the middle of the sea,\\nAnd, with fierce accents that appalled\\nAll creatures, to the VÃ¡nar called:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, prince of VÃ¡nars, doomed to be\\nMy food this day by heavenâ\\x80\\x99s decree.\\nSuch boon from ages long ago\\nTo BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s favouring will I owe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  She ceased, and HanumÃ¡n replied,\\nBy shape and threat unterrified:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBrave RÃ¡ma with his Maithil spouse\\nLodged in the shade of Daá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dakâ\\x80\\x99s boughs,\\nThence RÃ¡van king of giants stole\\nSÃ\\xadtÃ¡ the joy of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s soul.\\nBy RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s high behest to her\\nI go a willing messenger;\\nAnd never shouldst them hinder one\\nWho toils for DaÅ\\x9barathaâ\\x80\\x99s son.\\nFirst captive SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ will I see,\\nAnd him who sent and waits for me,\\nThen come and to thy will submit,\\nYea, by my truth I promise it.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNay, hope not thus thy life to save;\\nNot such the boon that BrahmÃ¡ gave.\\nEnter my mouth,â\\x80\\x9d was her reply,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen forward on thy journey hie!â\\x80\\x9d(796)\\n\\n  â\\x80\\x9cStretch, wider stretch thy jaws,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed\\nThe VÃ¡nar chief, to ire inflamed;\\nAnd, as the RÃ¡kshas near him drew,\\nTen leagues in height his stature grew.\\nThen straight, her threatening jaws between,\\nA gulf of twenty leagues was seen.\\nTo fifty leagues he waxed, and still\\nHer mouth grew wider at her will.\\nThen smaller than a thumb became,\\nShrunk by his power, the VÃ¡narâ\\x80\\x99s frame.(797)\\nHe leaped within, and turning round\\nSprang through the portal at a bound.\\nThen hung in air a moment, while\\nHe thus addressed her with a smile:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO Dakshaâ\\x80\\x99s child,(798) farewell at last!\\nFor I within thy mouth have passed.\\nThou hast the gift of BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s grace:\\nI go, the Maithil queen to trace.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen, to her former shape restored,\\nShe thus addressed the VÃ¡nar lord:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen forward to the task, and may\\nSuccess and joy attend thy way!\\nGo, and the rescued lady bring\\nIn triumph to her lord and king.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Then hosts of spirits as they gazed\\nThe daring of the VÃ¡nar praised.\\nThrough the broad fields of ether, fast\\nGaruá¸\\x8dâ\\x80\\x99s royal self, he passed,\\nThe region of the cloud and rain,\\nLoved by the gay Gandharva train,\\nWhere mid the birds that came and went\\nShone Indraâ\\x80\\x99s glorious bow unbent,\\nAnd like a host of wandering stars\\nFlashed the high Godsâ\\x80\\x99 celestial cars.\\nFierce SinhikÃ¡(799) who joyed in ill\\nAnd changed her form to work her will,\\nDescried him on his airy way\\nAnd marked the VÃ¡nar for her prey.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis day at length,â\\x80\\x9d the demon cried,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy hunger shall be satisfied,â\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd at his passing shadow caught\\nDelighted with the cheering thought.\\nThe VÃ¡nar felt the power that stayed\\nAnd held him as she grasped his shade,\\nLike some tall ship upon the main\\nThat struggles with the wind in vain.\\nBelow, above, his eye he bent\\nAnd scanned the sea and firmament.\\nHigh from the briny deep upreared\\nThe monsterâ\\x80\\x99s hideous form appeared,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s tale,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9cis true:\\nThis is the demon dire to view\\nOf whom the VÃ¡nar monarch told,\\nWhose grasp a passing shade can hold.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen, as a cloud in rain-time grows\\nHis form, dilating, swelled and rose.\\nWide as the space from heaven to hell\\nHer jaws she opened with a yell,\\nAnd rushed upon her fancied prey\\nWith cloud-like roar to seize and slay.\\nThe VÃ¡nar swift as thought compressed\\nHis borrowed bulk of limb and chest,\\nAnd stood with one quick bound inside\\nThe monstrous mouth she opened wide.\\nHid like the moon when RÃ¡hu draws\\nThe orb within his ravening jaws.\\nWithin that ample cavern pent\\nThe demonâ\\x80\\x99s form he tore and rent,\\nAnd, from the mangled carcass freed,\\nCame forth again with thought-like speed.(800)\\nThus with his skill the fiend he slew,\\nThen to his wonted stature grew.\\nThe spirits saw the demon die\\nAnd hailed the VÃ¡nar from the sky:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell hast thou fought a wondrous fight\\nNor spared the fiendâ\\x80\\x99s terrific might,\\nOn, on! perform the blameless deed,\\nAnd in thine every wish succeed.\\nNeâ\\x80\\x99er can they fail in whom combine\\nSuch valour, thought, and skill as thine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Pleased with their praises as they sang,\\nAgain through fields of air he sprang,\\nAnd now, his travail wellnigh done,\\nThe distant shore was almost won.\\nBefore him on the margent stood\\nIn long dark line a waving wood,\\nAnd the fair island, bright and green\\nWith flowers and trees, was clearly seen,\\nAnd every babbling brook that gave\\nHer lord the sea a tribute wave.\\nHe lighted down on Lambaâ\\x80\\x99s peak\\nWhich tinted metals stain and streak,\\nAnd looked where LankÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s

heard,\\nLoud as ten thousand drums, the roar\\nOf wild waves dashing on the shore.\\nThey saw him mounting to defy\\nWith deafening voice the troubled sky.\\nAnd the deep bed beneath him swell\\nIn

Evil omens are\\nseen and heard. The enemies meet, and many fall on each side, the VÃ¡nars\\ntransfixed with arrows, the RÃ¡kshases crushed with rocks and trees.\\n\\nIn Canto LVI Akampan sees that the RÃ¡kshases are worsted, and fights with\\nredoubled rage and vigour. The VÃ¡nars fall fast under his â\\x80\\x9cnets of\\narrows.â\\x80\\x9d HanumÃ¡n comes to the rescue. He throws mountain peaks at the\\ngiant which are dexterously stopped with flights of arrows; and at last\\nbeats him down and kills him with a tree.\\n\\nIn Canto LVII, RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 is seriously alarmed. He declares that he himself,\\nKumbhakará¹\\x87a or Prahasta, must go forth. Prahasta sallies out vaunting that\\nthe fowls of the air shall eat their fill of VÃ¡nar flesh.\\n\\nIn Canto LVIII, the two armies meet. Dire is the conflict; ceaseless is\\nthe rain of stones and arrows. At last NÃ\\xadla meets Prahasta and breaks his\\nbow. Prahasta leaps from his car, and the giant and the VÃ¡nar fight on\\nfoot. NÃ\\xadla with a huge tree crushes his opponent who falls like a tree\\nwhen its roots are cut.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LIX.

best\\nOf weapon-wielding chiefs, addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat captain leads this bright array\\nWhere lances gleam and banners play,\\nAnd thousands armed with spear and sword\\nAwait the bidding of

fate\\nAbandons to my deadly hate.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe spoke, and, firm by Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s side,\\nThe giant to the fray defied.\\nThe lord of LankÃ¡ bade his train\\nOf warriors by the gates remain,\\nTo guard the city from surprise\\nBy RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s forest born allies.\\nThen as some monster of the sea\\nCleaves swift-advancing billows, he\\nCharged with impetuous onset through\\nThe foe, and cleft the host in two.\\nSugrÃ\\xadva ran, the king to meet:\\nA hill uprooted from its seat\\nHe hurled, with trees that graced the height\\nAgainst the rover of the night:\\nBut cleft with shafts that checked its way\\nHarmless upon the earth it lay.\\nThen fiercer RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s fury grew,\\nAn arrow from his side he drew,\\nSwift as a thunderbolt, aglow\\nWith fire, and launched it at the foe.\\nThrough flesh and bone a way it found,\\nAnd stretched SugrÃ\\xadva on the ground.\\nSusheá¹\\x87 and Nala saw him fall,\\nGavÃ¡ksha, Gavaya heard their call,\\nAnd, poising hills, in act to fling\\nThey charged amain the giant king.\\nThey charged, they hurled the hills in vain,\\nHe checked them with his arrowy rain,\\nAnd every brave assailant felt\\nThe piercing wounds his missiles dealt,\\nThen smitten by the shafts that came\\nKeen, fleet, and thick, with certain aim,\\nThey fled to RÃ¡ma, sure defence\\nAgainst the oppressorâ\\x80\\x99s violence,\\nThen, reverent palm to palm applied,\\nThus Lakshmaá¹\\x87 to his brother cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo me, my lord, the task entrust\\nTo lay this giant in the

quelled:\\nTo meet the giantâ\\x80\\x99s car he ran,\\nRaised his right arm and thus began:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s boon thy life has screened\\nFrom Yaksha, God, Gandharva, fiend,\\nWith these contending fear no ill,\\nBut tremble at a VÃ¡nar still.â\\x80\\x9d\\nWith fury flashing from his eye\\nThe lord of LankÃ¡ made reply:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStrike, VÃ¡nar, strike: the fray begin,\\nAnd hope eternal fame to win.\\nThis arm shall prove thee in the strife\\nAnd end thy glory and thy life.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRemember,â\\x80\\x9d cried the Wind-Godâ\\x80\\x99s son,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRemember all that I have done,\\nMy prowess, King, thou knowest well,\\nShown in the fight when Aksha(963) fell.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  With heavy hand the giant smote\\nHanÃºmÃ¡n on the chest and throat,\\nWho reeled and staggered to and fro,\\nStunned for a moment by the blow.\\nTill, mustering strength, his hand he reared\\nAnd struck the foe whom Indra feared.\\nHis huge limbs bent beneath the shock,\\nAs mountains, in an earthquake, rock,\\nAnd from the Gods and sages pealed\\nShouts of loud triumph as he reeled.\\nBut strength returning nerved his frame:\\nHis eyeballs flashed with fiercer flame.\\nNo living creature might resist\\nThat blow of his tremendous fist\\nWhich fell upon HanÃºmÃ¡nâ\\x80\\x99s flank:\\nAnd to the ground the VÃ¡nar sank,\\nNo sign of life his body showed:\\nAnd RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 in his chariot rode\\nAt NÃ\\xadla; and his arrowy rain\\nFell on the captain and his train.\\nFierce NÃ\\xadla stayed his VÃ¡nar band,\\nAnd, heaving with his single hand\\nA mountain peak, with vigorous swing\\nHurled the huge missile at the king.\\n\\n  HanÃºmÃ¡n life and strength regained,\\nBurned for the fight and thus complained:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, coward giant, didst thou flee\\nAnd leave the doubtful fight with me?â\\x80\\x9d\\nSeven mighty arrows keen and fleet\\nThe giant launched, the hill to meet;\\nAnd, all its force and fury stayed,\\nThe harmless mass on earth was laid.\\nEnraged the VÃ¡nar chief beheld\\nThe mountain peak by force repelled,\\nAnd rained upon the foe a shower\\nOf trees uptorn with branch and flower.\\nStill his keen shafts which pierced and rent\\nEach flying tree the giant sent:\\nStill was the VÃ¡nar doomed to feel\\nThe tempest of the winged steel.\\nThen, smarting from that arrowy storm,\\nThe VÃ¡nar chief condensed his form,(964)\\nAnd lightly leaping from the ground\\nOn RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s standard footing found;\\nThen springing unimpeded down\\nStood on his bow and golden crown.\\nThe VÃ¡narâ\\x80\\x99s nimble leaps amazed\\nIkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s son who stood and gazed.\\nThe giant, raging in his heart,\\nLaid on his bow a fiery dart;\\nThe VÃ¡nar on his flagstaff eyed,\\nAnd thus in tones of fury cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell skilled in magic lore art thou:\\nBut will thine art avail thee now?\\nSee if thy magic will defend\\nThy life against the dart I send.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 spake, the giant king,\\nAnd loosed the arrow from the string.\\nIt pierced, with direst fury sped,\\nThe VÃ¡nar with its flaming head.\\nHis fatherâ\\x80\\x99s might, his power innate\\nPreserved him from the threatened fate.\\nUpon his knees he fell, distained\\nWith streams of blood, but life remained.\\n\\n  Still RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 for the battle burned:\\nAt Lakshmaá¹\\x87 next his car he turned,\\nAnd charged amain with furious show,\\nStraining in mighty hands his bow.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome,â\\x80\\x9d Lakshmaá¹\\x87 cried, â\\x80\\x9cassay the fight:\\nLeave foes unworthy of thy might.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThus Lakshmaá¹\\x87 spoke: and LankÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s lord\\nHeard the dread thunder of the cord.\\nAnd mad with burning rage and pride\\nIn hasty words like these replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJoy, joy is mine, O Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son:\\nThy fate to-day thou canst not shun.\\nSlain by mine arrows thou shalt tread\\nThe gloomy pathway of the dead.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus as he spoke his bow he drew,\\nAnd seven keen shafts at Lakshmaá¹\\x87 flew,\\nBut Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son with surest aim\\nCleft every arrow as it came.\\nThus with fleet shafts each warrior shot\\nAgainst his foe, and rested not.\\nThen one choice weapon from his store,\\nBy BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s self bestowed of yore,\\nFierce as the flames that end the world,\\nThe giant king at Lakshmaá¹\\x87 hurled.\\nThe hero fell, and racked with pain,\\nScarce could his hand his bow retain.\\nBut sense and strength resumed their seat\\nAnd, lightly springing to his feet,\\nHe struck with one tremendous stroke\\nAnd RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s bow in splinters broke.\\nFrom Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s cord three arrows flew\\nAnd pierced the giant monarch through.\\nSore wounded RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 closed, and round\\nIkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s son his strong arms wound.\\nWith strength unrivalled, BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s gift,\\nHe strove from earth his foe to lift.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall I,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9cwho overthrow\\nMount Meru and the Lord of Snow,\\nAnd heaven and all who dwell therein,\\nBe foiled by one of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s kin?â\\x80\\x9d\\nBut though he heaved, and toiled, and strained,\\nUnmoved IkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s son remained.\\nHis frame by those huge arms compressed\\nThe giantâ\\x80\\x99s God-given force confessed,\\nBut conscious that himself was part\\nOf Vishá¹\\x87u, he was firm in heart.\\n\\n  The Wind-Godâ\\x80\\x99s son the fight beheld,\\nAnd rushed at RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87, rage-impelled.\\nDown crashed his mighty hand; the foe\\nFull in the chest received the blow.\\nHis eyes grew dim, his knees gave way,\\nAnd senseless on the earth he lay.\\n\\n  The Wind-Godâ\\x80\\x99s son to RÃ¡ma bore\\nDeep-wounded Lakshmaá¹\\x87 stained with gore.\\nHe whom no foe might lift or bend\\nWas light as air to such a friend.\\nThe dart that Lakshmaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s side had cleft,\\nUntouched, the heroâ\\x80\\x99s body left,\\nAnd flashing through the air afar\\nResumed its place in RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s car;\\nAnd, waxing well though wounded sore,\\nHe felt the deadly pain no more.\\nAnd RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87, though with deep wounds pained,\\nSlowly his sense and strength regained,\\nAnd furious still and undismayed\\nOn bow and shaft his hand he laid.\\n\\n  Then HanumÃ¡n to RÃ¡ma cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAscend my back, great chief, and ride\\nLike Vishá¹\\x87u borne on Garuá¸\\x8dâ\\x80\\x99s wing,\\nTo battle with the giant king.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSo, burning for the dire attack,\\nRode RÃ¡ma on the VÃ¡narâ\\x80\\x99s back,\\nAnd with fierce accents loud and slow\\nThus gave defiance to the foe,\\nWhile his strained bowstring made a sound\\nLike thunder when it shakes the ground:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStay, Monarch of the giants, stay,\\nThe penalty of sin to pay.\\nStay! whither wilt thou fly, and how\\nEscape the death that waits thee now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  No word the giant king returned:\\nHis eyes with flames of fury burned.\\nHis arm was stretched, his bow was bent,\\nAnd swift his fiery shafts were sent.\\nRed torrents from the VÃ¡nar flowed:\\nThen RÃ¡ma near to RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 strode,\\nAnd with keen darts that never failed,\\nThe chariot of the king assailed.\\nWith surest aim his arrows flew:\\nThe driver and the steeds he slew.\\nAnd shattered with the pointed steel\\nCar, flag, and pole and yoke and wheel.\\nAs Indra hurls his bolt to smite\\nMount Meruâ\\x80\\x99s heaven-ascending height,\\nSo RÃ¡ma with a flaming dart\\nStruck LankÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s monarch near the heart,\\nWho reeled and fell beneath the blow\\nAnd from loose fingers dropped his bow.\\nBright as the sun, with crescent head,\\nFrom RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s bow an arrow sped,\\nAnd from his forehead, proud no more,\\nCleft the bright coronet he wore.\\nThen RÃ¡ma stood by RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s side\\nAnd to the conquered giant cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell hast thou fought: thine arm has slain\\nStrong heroes of the VÃ¡nar train.\\nI will not strike or slay thee now,\\nFor weary, faint with fight art thou.\\nTo LankÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s town thy footsteps bend,\\nAnd there the night

giant raised his arm, and fast\\nCame the tremendous(980) spear he cast.\\nHanÃºmÃ¡n caught it as it flew,\\nAnd knapped it on his knee in two.\\nThe giant saw the broken spear:\\nHis clouded eye confessed his fear;\\nYet at SugrÃ\\xadvaâ\\x80\\x99s head he sent\\nA peak from LankÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s mountain rent.\\nThe rushing mass no might could stay:\\nSugrÃ\\xadva fell and senseless lay.\\nThe giant stooped his foe to seize,\\nAnd bore him thence, as bears the breeze\\nA cloud in autumn through the sky.\\nHe heard the sad Immortals sigh,\\nAnd shouts of triumph long and loud\\nWent up from all the RÃ¡kshas crowd.\\nThrough LankÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s gate the giant passed\\nHolding his struggling captive fast,\\nWhile from each terrace, house, and tower\\nFell on his haughty head a shower\\nOf fragrant scent and flowery rain,\\nBlossoms and leaves and scattered grain.(981)\\n\\n  By slow degrees the VÃ¡narsâ\\x80\\x99 lord\\nFelt life and sense and strength restored.\\nHe heard the

gore,\\nHurled to the ground the load he bore.\\nRegardless of a storm of blows\\nSwift to the sky the VÃ¡nar rose,\\nThen lightly like a flying ball\\nHigh overleapt the city wall,\\nAnd joyous for deliverance won\\nRegained the side of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son.\\nAnd Kumbhakará¹\\x87a, mad with hate\\nAnd fury, sallied from the gate,\\nThe carnage of the foe renewed\\nAnd filled his maw with gory

felt the sting\\nOf keen shafts loosened from the string.\\nHis heart confessed the warriorâ\\x80\\x99s power,\\nAnd, bleeding from the ceaseless shower\\nThat smote him on the chest and side,\\nWith words like these the giant cried:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell fought, well fought, SumitrÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s son;\\nEternal glory hast thou won,\\nFor thou in desperate fight hast met\\nThe victor never conquered yet,\\nWhom, borne on huge AirÃ¡vatâ\\x80\\x99s back,\\nEâ\\x80\\x99en Indra trembles to attack.\\nGo, son of Queen SumitrÃ¡, go:\\nThy valour and thy strength I know.\\nNow all my hope and earnest will\\nIs RÃ¡ma in the fight to kill.\\nLet him beneath my weapons fall,\\nAnd I will meet and conquer all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The chieftain, of SumitrÃ¡ born,\\nMade answer as he laughed in

know.\\nThere, famous in a hundred lands,\\nRÃ¡ma the son of Raghu stands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Straight at the king the giant sped,\\nAnd earth was shaken at his tread.\\nHis bow the hero grasped and strained,\\nAnd deadly shafts in torrents rained.\\nAs Kumbhakará¹\\x87a felt each stroke\\nFrom his huge mouth burst fire and smoke;\\nHis hands were loosed in mortal pain\\nAnd dropped his weapons on the plain.\\nThough reft of spear and sword and mace\\nNo terror changed his haughty face.\\nWith heavy hands he rained his blows\\nAnd smote to death a thousand foes.\\nWhereâ\\x80\\x99er the furious monster strode\\nWhile down his limbs the red blood flowed\\nLike torrents down a mountainâ\\x80\\x99s side,\\nVÃ¡nars and bears and giants died.\\nHigh oâ\\x80\\x99er his head a rock he swung,\\nAnd the huge mass at RÃ¡ma flung.\\nBut RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s arrows bright as flame\\nShattered the mountain as it came.\\nThen Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s son, his eyes aglow\\nWith burning anger, charged the foe,\\nAnd as his bow he strained and tried\\nWith fearful clang the cord replied.\\nWroth at the bowstringâ\\x80\\x99s threatening clang\\nTo meet his foe the giant sprang.\\nHigh towering with enormous frame\\nHuge as a wood-crowned hill he came.\\nBut RÃ¡ma firm and self-possessed\\nIn words like these the foe addressed:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDraw near, O RÃ¡kshas lord, draw near,\\nNor turn thee from the fight in fear.\\nThou meetest RÃ¡ma face to face,\\nDestroyer of the giant race.\\nCome, fight, and thou shalt feel this hour,\\nLaid low in death, thy conquerorâ\\x80\\x99s power.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He ceased: and mad with wrath and pride\\nThe giant champion thus replied:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome thou to me and thou shalt find\\nA foeman of a different kind.\\nNo Khara, no VirÃ¡dha,â\\x80\\x94thou\\nHast met a mightier warrior now.\\nThe strength of Kumbhakará¹\\x87a fear,\\nAnd dread the iron mace I rear\\nThis mace in days of yore subdued\\nThe Gods and DÃ¡nav multitude.\\nProve, lion of IkshvÃ¡kuâ\\x80\\x99s line,\\nThy power upon these limbs of mine.\\nThen, after trial, shalt thou bleed,\\nAnd with thy flesh my hunger feed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  He ceased: and RÃ¡ma, undismayed,\\nUpon his cord those arrows laid\\nWhich pierced the stately SÃ¡l trees through,\\nAnd BÃ¡li king of VÃ¡nars slew.\\nThey flew, they smote, but smote in vain\\nThose mighty limbs that felt no pain.\\nThen RÃ¡ma sent with surest aim\\nThe dart that bore the Wind-Godâ\\x80\\x99s name.\\nThe missile from the giant tore\\nHis huge arm and the mace it bore,\\nWhich crushed the VÃ¡nars where it fell:\\nAnd dire was Kumbhakará¹\\x87aâ\\x80\\x99s yell.\\nThe giant seized a tree, and then\\nRushed madly at the lord of men.\\nAnother dart, Lord Indraâ\\x80\\x99s own,\\nTo meet his furious onset thrown,\\nHis left arm from the shoulder lopped,\\nAnd like a mountain peak it dropped.\\nThen from the bow of RÃ¡ma sped\\nTwo arrows, each with crescent head;\\nAnd, winged with might which naught could stay,\\nThey cut the giantâ\\x80\\x99s legs away.\\nThey fell, and awful was the sound\\nAs those vast columns shook the ground;\\nAnd sky and sea and hill and cave\\nIn echoing roars their answer gave.\\nThen from his side the hero drew\\nA dart that like the tempest flewâ\\x80\\x94\\nNo deadlier shaft has ever flown\\nThan that which Indra called his ownâ\\x80\\x94\\nNor could the giantâ\\x80\\x99s mail-armed neck\\nThe fury of the missile check.\\nThrough skin and flesh and bone it smote\\nAnd rent asunder head and throat.\\nDown with the sound of thunder rolled\\nThe head adorned with rings of gold,\\nAnd crushed to pieces in its fall\\nA gate, a tower, a massive wall.\\nHurled to the sea the body fell:\\nTerrific was the oceanâ\\x80\\x99s swell,\\nNor could swift fin and nimble leap\\nSave the crushed creatures of the deep.\\n\\n  Thus he who plagued in impious pride\\nThe Gods and BrÃ¡hmans fought and died.\\nGlad were the hosts of heaven, and long\\nThe air re-echoed with their song.(983)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanto LXVIII.

Hither were previously\\ncollected the gods, with the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the sages, for\\nthe sake of receiving their respective shares, BrahmÃ¡ too, the sovereign\\nof the gods, with SthÃ¡á¹\\x87u, and NÃ¡rÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a, chief of beings and the four\\nsupporters of the universe, and the divine mothers of all the celestials,\\nmet together there. To the AÅ\\x9bvamedha, the great sacrifice of the\\nmagnanimous monarch, came also Indra the glorious one, surrounded by the\\nMaruts. RishyaÅ\\x9bring then supplicated the gods assembled for their share of\\nthe sacrifice (saying), â\\x80\\x9cThis devout king DaÅ\\x9baratha, who, through the\\ndesire of offspring, confiding in you, has performed sacred austerities,\\nand who has offered to you the sacrifice called AÅ\\x9bvamedha, is about to\\nperform another sacrifice for the sake of obtaining sons: To him thus\\ndesirous of offspring be pleased to grant the blessing: I supplicate you\\nall with joined hands. May he have four sons, renowned through the\\nuniverse.â\\x80\\x9d The gods replied to the sageâ\\x80\\x99s son supplicating with joined\\nhands, â\\x80\\x9cBe it so: thou, O BrÃ¡hman, art ever to be regarded by us, as the\\nking is in a peculiar manner. The lord of men by this sacrifice shall\\nobtain the great object of his desires.â\\x80\\x9d Having thus said, the gods\\npreceded by Indra, disappeared.\\n\\nThey all then having seen that (sacrifice) performed by the great sage\\naccording to the ordinance went to PrajÃ¡pati the lord of mankind, and with\\njoined hands addressed BrahmÃ¡ the giver of blessings, â\\x80\\x9cO BrahmÃ¡, the\\nRÃ¡ksha RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a by name, to whom a blessing was awarded by thee, through\\npride troubleth all of us the gods, and even the great sages, who\\nperpetually practise sacred austerities. We, O glorious one, regarding the\\npromise formerly granted by thy kindness that he should be invulnerable to\\nthe gods, the DÃ¡navas and the Yakshas have born (_sic_) all, (his\\noppression); this lord of RÃ¡kshas therefore distresses the universe; and,\\ninflated by this promise unjustly vexes the divine sages, the Yakshas, and\\nGandharvas, the Asuras, and men: where RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a remains there the sun loses\\nhis force, the winds through fear of him do not blow; the fire ceases to\\nburn; the rolling ocean, seeing him, ceases to move its waves. ViÅ\\x9bravas,\\ndistressed by his power, has abandoned LankÃ¡ and fled. O divine one save\\nus from RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a, who fills the world with noise and tumult. O giver of\\ndesired things, be pleased to contrive a way for his destruction.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBrahmÃ¡ thus informed by the devas, reflecting, replied, â\\x80\\x9cOh! I have\\ndevised the method for slaying this outrageous tyrant. Upon his\\nrequesting, â\\x80\\x98May I be invulnerable to the divine sages, the Gaundharvas,\\nthe Yakshas, the RÃ¡kshasas and the serpents,â\\x80\\x99 I replied â\\x80\\x98Be it so.â\\x80\\x99 This\\nRÃ¡ksha, through contempt, said nothing respecting man; therefore this\\nwicked one shall be destroyed by man.â\\x80\\x9d The gods, preceded by Å\\x9aakra,\\nhearing these words spoken by BrahmÃ¡, were filled with joy.\\n\\nAt this time Vishá¹\\x87u the glorious, the lord of the world, arrayed in\\nyellow, with hand ornaments of glowing gold, riding on Vinateya, as the\\nsun on a cloud, arrived with his conch, his discus, and his club in his\\nhand. Being adored by the excellent celestials, and welcomed by BrahmÃ¡, he\\ndrew near and stood before him. All the gods then addressed Vishá¹\\x87u, â\\x80\\x9cO\\nMadhusudana, thou art able to abolish the distress of the distressed. We\\nintreat thee, be our sanctuary, O Vishá¹\\x87u.â\\x80\\x9d Vishá¹\\x87u replied, â\\x80\\x9cSay, what\\nshall I do?â\\x80\\x9d The celestials hearing these his words added further. â\\x80\\x9cThe\\nvirtuous, the encourager of excellence, eminent for truth, the firm\\nobserver of his vows, being childless, is performing an AÅ\\x9bvamedha for the\\npurpose of obtaining offspring. For the sake of the good of the universe,\\nwe intreat thee, O Vishá¹\\x87u, to become his son. Dividing thyself into four\\nparts, in the wombs of his three consorts equal to Hari, Å\\x9arÃ\\xad, and Kirti,\\nassume the sonship of king DaÅ\\x9baratha, the lord of AyodhyÃ¡, eminent in the\\nknowledge of duty, generous and illustrious, as the great sages. Thus\\nbecoming man, O Vishá¹\\x87u, conquer in battle RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a, the terror of the\\nuniverse, who is invulnerable to the gods. This ignorant RÃ¡kshasa RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a,\\nby the exertion of his power, afflicts the gods, the Gandharvaa, the\\nSiddhas, and the most excellent sages; these sages, the Gandharvas, and\\nthe Apsaras, sporting in the forest Nandana have been destroyed by that\\nfurious one. We, with the sages, are come to thee seeking his destruction.\\nThe Siddhas, the Gandharvas, and the Yakshas betake themselves to thee,\\nthou art our only refuge; O Deva, afflicter of enemies, regard the world\\nof men, and destroy the enemy of the gods.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVishá¹\\x87u, the sovereign of the gods, the chief of the celestials, adored by\\nall beings, being thus supplicated, replied to all the assembled gods\\n(standing) before BrahmÃ¡, â\\x80\\x9cAbandon fear; peace be with you; for your\\nbenefit having killed RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a the cruel, destructively active, the cause of\\nfear to the divine sages, together with all his posterity, his courtiers\\nand counsellors, and his relations, and friends, protecting the earth, I\\nwill remain incarnate among men for the space of eleven thousand years.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHaving given this promise to the gods, the divine Vishá¹\\x87u, ardent in the\\nwork, sought a birth-place among men. Dividing himself into four parts, he\\nwhose eyes resemble the lotus and the pulasa, the lotus petal-eyed, chose\\nfor his father DaÅ\\x9baratha the sovereign of men. The divine sages then with\\nthe Gandharvas, the Rudras, and the (different sorts of) Apsaras, in the\\nmost excellent strains, praised the destroyer of Madhu, (saying) â\\x80\\x9cRoot up\\nRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a, of fervid energy, the devastator, the enemy of Indra swollen with\\npride. Destroy him, who causes universal lamentation, the annoyer of the\\nholy ascetics, terrible, the terror of the devout Tapaswis. Having\\ndestroyed RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a, tremendously powerful, who causes universal weeping,\\ntogether with his army and friends, dismissing all sorrow, return to\\nheaven, the place free from stain and sin, and protected by the sovereign\\nof the celestial powers.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThus far the Section, containing the plan for the death of RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87.\\n\\nCAREY AND MARSHMAN.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCaput XIV.

Tum coepit modestus\\nVibhÃ¢ndaci filius, regis commodis intentus, parare sacrum, quo eius\\ndesiderium expleret. Iamâ\\x80\\x99antea eo convenerant, ut suam quisque portionem\\nacciperent, DÃ® cum fidicinum coelestium choris, Beatique cum Sapientibus;\\nBrachman SuperÃ»m regnator, SthÃ¢nus nec non augustus NÃ¢rÃ¢yanus, Indrasque\\nalmus, coram visendus Ventorum cohorte circumdatus, in magno isto\\nsacrificio equino regis magnanimi. Ibidem vates ille deos, qui portiones\\nsuas accipiendi gratia advenerant, apprecatus, En inquit, hicce ex\\nDasarathus filiorum desiderio castimoniis adstrictus, fidei plenus,\\nvestrum numen adoravit sacrificio equino. Nunc iterum accingit se ad aliud\\nsacrum peragendum: quamobrem aequum est, ut filios cupienti vos faveatis.\\nIlle ego, qui manus supplices tendo, vos universos pro eo apprecor:\\nnascantur ei filii quatuor, faina per triplicem mundum clari. Divi\\nsupplicem vatis filium invicem affari: Fiat quod petis! Tu nobis,\\nvirsancte, imprimis es venerandus, nee minus rex ille; compos fiet voti\\nsui egregii hominum princeps. Ita locuti DÃ® Indra duce, ex oculis\\nevanuerunt.\\n\\nSuperi vero, legitime in concilio congregati. BRACHMANEM mundi creatorem\\nhis verbis compellarunt: Tuo munere auctus, O Brachman! gigas nomine\\nRÃ¢vanas, prae superbia nos omnes vexat, pariterque Sapientes castimoniis\\ngaudentes. A te propitio olim ex voto ei hoc munus concessum fuit, ut ne a\\ndiis, Danuidis, Geniisve necari posset. Nos, oraculum tuum reveriti,\\nfacinora eius qualiacunque toleramus. At ille gigantum tyrannus ternos\\nmundos gravibus iniuriis vexat Deos, Sapientes, Genios, Fidicines\\ncoelestes, Titanes, mortales denique, exsuperat ille aegre cohibendus,\\ntuoque munere demens. Non ibi calet sol, neque Ventus prae timore spirat,\\nnee flagrat ignis, ubi RÃ¢vanas versatur. Ipse oceanus, vagis fluctibus\\nredimitus, isto viso stat immotus; eiectus fuit e sede sua CuvÃªrus, huius\\nrobore vexatus. Ergo ingens nobis periculum imminet ab hoc gigante visu\\nhorribili; tuum est, alme Parens! auxilium parare, quo hic deleatur. Ita\\nadmonitus ille a diis universis, paulisper meditatus, Ehem! inquit, hancce\\ninveni rationem nefarium istum necandi. Petierat is a me, ut a Gandharvis,\\na Geniis, a Divis, Danuibus Gigantibusque necari non posset et me annuente\\nvoto suo potitus est. Prae contemptu vero monstrum illud homines non\\ncommemoravit: ideo ab homine est necandus: nullum aliud exstat leti genus,\\nquod ei sit fatale. Postquam audiverant gratum hunc sermonem BRACHMANIS\\nore prolatum, DÃ® cum duce suo Indra summopere gaudio erecti sunt. Eodem\\ntemporis momento Vishnus, istuc accessit, splendore insignis, concham,\\ndiscum et clavum manibus gestans, croceo vestitu, mundi dominus, vulturis\\nVinateii dorso, sicuti sol nimbo, vectus, armillas ex auro candente\\ngerens, salutatus a SuperÃ»m primoribus.

Sis praesidio\\nnobis numine tuo inconcusso. Dicite, inquit Vishnus, quid pro vobis facere\\nme oporteat. Audito eius sermone, DÃ® hunc in modum respondent: Rex quidam,\\nnomine Dasarathus, austeris castimoniis sese castigavit, litavit\\nsacrificio equino, prolis cupidus et prole carens. Nostro hortatu tu,\\nVishnus, conditionem natorum eius subeas: ex tribus eius uxoribus,\\nPudicitiae, Venustatis et Famae similibus, nasci, velis, temetipsum\\nquadrifariam dividens.

Ut deoram\\nhostes extinguas, ad sortem humanam animum converte. Augustus ille\\nNÃ¢rÃ¢yanus, diis hunc in modum coram hortantibus, eosdem apto hoc sermone\\ncompellavit: Quare, quaeso, hac in re negotium vestrum a me potissimum,\\ncorporea specie palam facto, est peragendum aut unde tantus vobis terror\\nfuit iniectus? His verbis a VishnÃ» interrogati DÃ® talia proferre: Terror\\nnobis instat, O Vishnus! a RÃ¢vana mundi direptore; a quo nos vindicare,\\ncorpore humano assumpto, tuum est. Nemo alius coelicoiarum praeter te hunc\\nscelestum enecare potis est. Nimirum ille, O hostium domitor! per\\ndiuturnum tempus sese excruciaverat severissima abstinentia, qua magnus\\nhicce rerum Parens propitius ipsi redditus est. Itaque almus votorum\\nsponsor olim ei concessit securitatem ab ommibus animantibus, hominibus\\ntamen exceptis.

IL MEZZO STABILITO PER UCCIDERE RÃ\\x81VANO.\\n\\n\\nMa Riseyasringo soggiunse poscia al re: TappresterÃ² io un altro rito\\nsantissimo, genitale, onde tu conseguisca la prole che tu bramÃ\\xad. E in quel\\npunto stesso il saggio figliulo di VibhÃ¢ndaco, intento alla prosperitÃ\\xa0 del\\nre, pose mano al sacro rito per condurre ad effetto il suo desiderio. GiÃ\\xa0\\nerano prima, per ricevere ciascuno la sua parte, qui convenuti al gran\\nsacrifizio del re magnanimo lâ\\x80\\x99Asvamedha, i Devi coi Gandharvi, i Siddhi e\\ni Muni, Brahma Signor dei Sari, SthÃ¢nu e lâ\\x80\\x99 Augusto NÃ¢rÃ¢yana, i quattio\\ncustodi dellâ\\x80\\x99 universo e le Madri degli Iddu, i Yacsi insieme cogli Dei, e\\nil sovrano, venerando Indra, visibile, circondato dalla schiera dei\\nMaruti. Quivi cosÃ¬ parlÃ² Riscyasringo agli Dei venuti a partecipare del\\nsacrifizio: Questo Ã¨ il re Dasaratha, che per desiderio di progenie giÃ\\xa0 sâ\\x80\\x99\\nastrinse ad osservanze austerÃ©, e testÃ¨ pieno di fede ha a voi, O eccelsi,\\nsacrificato con un Asvamedha. Ora egli, sollecito dâ\\x80\\x99 aver figli, si\\ndispone ad adempiere un nuovo rito; vogliate essere favorevole a lui che\\nsospira progenie. Io alzo a voi supplici le mani, e voi tutti per lui\\nimploro: nascano a lui quattro figli degni dâ\\x80\\x99essere celebrati pei tre\\nmondi. Risposero gli Dei al supplichevole figliuolo del Risci: Sia fatto\\nciÃ² che chiedi; a te ed al re parimente si debbe da noi, O Brahmano, sommo\\npregio; canseguirÃ\\xa0 il re per questo sacro rito il suo suppremo desiderio.\\nCiÃ² detto disparvero i Numi preceduti da Indra.\\n\\nPoichÃ¨ videro gli Dei compiersi debitamente dal gran Risci lâ\\x80\\x99oblazione,\\nvenuti al cospetto di Brahma facitor del mondo, signor delle creature,\\ncosÃ¬ parlarono reverenti a lui dator di grazie: O Brahma, un Racsaso per\\nnome RÃ¢vano, eui tu fosti largo del tuo favore, Ã¨ per superbia infesto a\\nnoi tutti e ai grandi Saggi penitenti. Un di, O Nume, augusto, tu propizio\\na lui gli accordasti il favore, châ\\x80\\x99 egli bramava, di non poter essere\\nucciso dagli Dei, dai DÃ¢navi nÃ¨ dai Yacsi: noi venerando i tuoi oracoli,\\nogni cosa sopportiamo da costui. Quindi il signor dei Racsasi infesta con\\nperpetue offese i tre mondi, i Devi, i Risci, i Yacsi ed i Gandharvi, gli\\nAsuri e gli uomini: tutti egli opprime indegnamente inorgoglito pel tuo\\ndono. ColÃ\\xa0 dove si trova RÃ¢vano, piÃ¹ non isfavilla per timore il sole, piÃ¹\\nnon spira il vento, piÃ¹ non fiammeggia il fuoco: lâ\\x80\\x99 oceano stesso cui fan\\ncorona i vasti flutti, veggendo costui, tutto si turba e si commuove.\\nStretto dalla forza di costui e ridotto allo stremo dovette Vaisravano\\nabbandonare LancÃ¢. Da questo RÃ¢vano, terror del mondo, tu ne proteggi, O\\nalmo Nume: degna, O dator dâ\\x80\\x99ogni bene, trovar modo ad estirpar costui.\\nFatto di queste cose conscio dai Devi, stette alquanto meditando, poi\\nrispose Brahma: OrsÃ¹! Ã¨ stabilito il modo onde distruggere questo iniquo.\\nEgli a me chiese, ed io gliel concessi, di non poter essere ucciso dai\\nDevi, dai Risci, dai Gandharvi, dai Yacsi, dai Racsasi nÃ¨ dai Serpenti; ma\\nper disprezzo non fece menzione degli uomini quel Racso: or bene, sarÃ\\xa0\\nquellâ\\x80\\x99 empio ucciso da un uomo. Udite le fauste parole profferte da\\nBrahma, furono per ogni parte liete gli Iddii col loro duce Indra. In\\nquesto mezzo quÃ¬ sopravvenne raggiante dâ\\x80\\x99immensa luce il venerando Visnu,\\npensato da Brahma nellâ\\x80\\x99 immortal sua mente, siccome atto ad estirpar\\ncolui; Allora Brahma colla schiera deâ\\x80\\x99 Celesti cosÃ¬ parlÃ² a Visnu: Tu sei\\nil conforto delle gente oppresse, O distruttor di Madhu: noi quindi a te\\nsupplichiamo afflitti: sia tu nostro sostegno, O Aciuto. Dite, loro\\nrispose Visnu, quale cosa io debba far per voi; e gli Dei, udite queste\\nparole, cosi soggiunsero: Un re per nome Dasaratha, giusto, virtuoso,\\nveridico e pio, non ha progenie e la desidera: ei giÃ\\xa0 sâ\\x80\\x99 impose durissime\\npenitenze, ed ora ha sacrificato con un Asvamedha: tu, per nostro\\nconsiglio, O Visnu, consenti a divenir suo figlio: fatte di te quattro\\nparti, ti manifesta, O invocato dalle genti, nel seno delle quattro sue\\nconsorti, simili alla venusta Dea. CosÃ¬ esortato dagli Dei quivi presenti,\\nlâ\\x80\\x99augusto NÃ¢rÃ¢yana loro rispose queste opportune parole: Quale opra sâ\\x80\\x99ha\\nda me, fatto visible nel mondo, a compiere per voi, O Devi? e dâ\\x80\\x99onde in\\nvoi cotal terrore? Intese le parole di Visnu, cosÃ¬ risposero gli Dei: Il\\nnostro terrore. O Visnu, nasce da un Racsaso per nome RÃ¢vano, spavento\\ndellâ\\x80\\x99 universo. Vestendo umano corpo, tu debbi esterminar costui. Nessuno\\nfra i Celesti, fuorchÃ¨ tu solo, Ã¨ valevole ad uccidere quellâ\\x80\\x99 iniquo.\\nEgli, O domator deâ\\x80\\x99 tuoi nemici, sostenne per lungo tempo acerbissime\\nmacerazioni: per esse fu di lui contento lâ\\x80\\x99augusto sommo Genitore: e un di\\ngli accordÃ² propizio la sicurezza da tutti gli esseri, eccettutine gli\\nuomini. Per questo favore a lui concesso nou ha egli a temere offesa da\\nalcuna parte, fuorchÃ¨ dallâ\\x80\\x99 uomo, perciÃ², assumendo la natura umana,\\ncostui tu uccidi. Egli, il peggior di tutti i Racsasi, insano per la forza\\nche gli infonde il dono avuto, da travaglio ai Devi ed ai Gaudharvi, ai\\nRisci, ai Muni ed ai mortali. Egli, sicuro da morte pel favore ottenuto, Ã¨\\nturbatore dei sacrifizj, nemico ed uccisor dei Brahmi, divoratore degli\\nuomini, peste del mondo. Da lui furono assaliti re coi loro carri ed\\nelefanti; altri percessi e fugati si dispersero per ogni dove. Da lui\\nfurono divorati Risci ed Apsarase: egli insomma oltracotato continuamente\\ne quasi per ischerzo tutti travaglia i sette mondi. PerciÃ², O terribile ai\\nnemici Ã¨ stabilita la morte di costui per opra dâ\\x80\\x99un uomo; poichâ\\x80\\x99 un di per\\nsuperbia del dono tutti sprezzÃ² gli uomini.

Enorgueilli de ce don\\nvictorieux, il opprime indignement les Dieux, les rishis, les Yakshas, les\\nGandharvas, les Asouras et les enfants de Manou. LÃ\\xa0 ou se tient RÃ¢vana, la\\npeur empÃªche le soleil dâ\\x80\\x99Ã©chauffer, le vent craint de souffler, et le feu\\nnâ\\x80\\x99ose flamboyer.

LÃ¡, dans ce mÃªme instant, survint le fortunÃ© Visnou, revÃªtu dâ\\x80\\x99 une\\nsplendeur infinie; car câ\\x80\\x99Ã©tait a lui, que Brahma avait pensÃ© dans son Ã¢me\\npour la mort du tyran. Celui-ci donc avec lâ\\x80\\x99essaim des Immortels adresse Ã\\xa0\\nVishnou ces paroles: â\\x80\\x9cMeurtrier de Madhou, comme tu aimes Ã¡ tirer de\\nlâ\\x80\\x99affliction les Ãªtres malheureux, nous te supplions, nous qui sommes\\nplongÃ©s dans la tristesse, DivinitÃ© auguste, sois notre asyle!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDites!\\nreprit Vishnou; que dois-je faire?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAyant oui les paroles de lâ\\x80\\x99ineffable,\\ntous les Dieux repondirent: Il est un roi nommÃ© DaÃ§aratha; il a embrassÃ©\\nune trÃ¨s-durÃ© pÃ©nitence; il a cÃ©lÃ©brÃ© mÃªme le sacrifice dâ\\x80\\x99un aÃ§wa-medha,\\nparce quâ\\x80\\x99il nâ\\x80\\x99a point de fils et quâ\\x80\\x99il veut en obtenir du ciel. Il est\\ninÃ©branlable dans sa piÃ©tÃ©, il est vantÃ© pour ses vertus; la justice est\\nson caractÃ¨re, la verite est sa parole. Acquiesce donc Ã\\xa0 notre demande, Ã´\\ntoi, Vishnou, et consens Ã\\xa0 naÃ®tre comme son fils. DivisÃ© en quatre\\nportions de toi-mÃªme, daigne, Ã´ toi, qui foules aux pieds tes ennemis,\\ndaigne tâ\\x80\\x99 incarner dans le sein de ses trois Ã©pouses, belles comme la\\ndÃ©esse de la beautÃ©.â\\x80\\x9d NÃ¡rÃ¡yana, le maÃ®tre, _non perceptible aux sens, mais\\nqui alors sâ\\x80\\x99 Ã©tait rendu_ visible, NÃ¡rÃ¡yana rÃ©pondit cette parole\\nsalutaire aux Dieux, qui i invitaient Ã\\xa0 cet _heroique avatÃ¡ra_. Quelle\\nchose, une fois revÃªtu de cette incarnation, faudra-t-il encore que je\\nfasse pour vous, et de quelle part vient la terreur, qui vous trouble\\nainsi? A ces mots du grand Vishnou: â\\x80\\x9cCâ\\x80\\x99est le dÃ©mon RÃ¡vana, reprirent les\\nDieux; câ\\x80\\x99est lui, Vishnou, cette dÃ©solation des mondes, qui nous inspire\\nun tel effroi. Enveloppe-toi dâ\\x80\\x99un corps, humain, et quâ\\x80\\x99il te plaise\\narrÃ¢cher du monde cette blessante epine; car nul autre que toi parmi les\\nhabitants du ciel nâ\\x80\\x99est capable dâ\\x80\\x99immoler ce pÃ©cheur. _Sache que_\\nlongtemps il sâ\\x80\\x99est imposÃ© la plus austÃ©re pÃ©nitence, et _que_ par elle il\\nsâ\\x80\\x99est rendu agreable au suprÃªme ayeul de toutes les crÃ©atures. Aussi le\\ndistributeur ineffable des grÃ\\xa0ces lui a-t-il accordÃ© ce don insigne dâ\\x80\\x99Ãªtre\\ninvulnÃ©rable Ã\\xa0 tous les Ãªtres, lâ\\x80\\x99 homme seul exceptÃ©. Puisque, douÃ© ainsi\\nde cette faveur, la mort terrible et sÃ»re ne peut venir Ã\\xa0 lui de nulle\\nautre part que de lâ\\x80\\x99homme, va, dompteur _puissant_ de tes ennemis, va dans\\nla condition humaine, et tue-le. Car ce don, auquel on ne peut rÃ©sister,\\nÃ©levant au plus haut point lâ\\x80\\x99ivresse de sa force, le vil rakshasa\\ntourmente les Dieux, les rishis, les Gandharvas, les hommes sanctifiÃ©s par\\nla pÃ©nitence; et, quoique, destructeur des sacrifices, lacÃ©rateur des\\nSaintes Ecritures, ennemi des brahmes, dÃ©vorateur des hommes, cette faveur\\nincomparable sauve de la mort RÃ¡vana le triste flÃ©au des mondes. Il ose\\nattaquer les rois, que dÃ©fendant les chars de guerre, que remparent les\\nÃ©lephants: dâ\\x80\\x99autres blessÃ©s et mis en fuite, sont dissipÃ©s Ã§a et lÃ\\xa0 devant\\nlui. Il a dÃ©vorÃ© des saints, il a dÃ©vorÃ© mÃªme une foule dâ\\x80\\x99apsaras. Sans\\ncesse, dans son dÃ©lire, il sâ\\x80\\x99amuse Ã\\xa0 tourmenter les sept mondes. Comme _on\\nvient de nous apprendre quâ\\x80\\x99_ il nâ\\x80\\x99a point daignÃ© parler dâ\\x80\\x99eux ce jour, que\\nlui fut donnÃ©e cette faveur, _dont il abuse_, entre dans un corps humain,\\nÃ´ toi, qui peux briser tes ennemis, et jette sans vie Ã\\xa0 tes pieds, roi\\npuissant des treize Dieux, ce RÃ¡vana superbe, dâ\\x80\\x99une force Ã©pouvantable,\\ndâ\\x80\\x99un orgueil immense, lâ\\x80\\x99ennemi de tous les ascÃ¨tes, ce ver, _qui les\\nronge_, cette cause de leurs gÃ©missements.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n_Ici, dans le premier tome du saint RÃ¢mÃ¢yana_, Finit le quatorziÃ¨me\\nchapitre, nommÃ©: UN EXPÃ\\x89DIENT POUR TUER RÃ\\x81VANA.\\n\\nHIPPOLYTE FAUCHE.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUttarakÃ¡nda.\\n\\n\\nThe RÃ¡mÃ¡yan ends, epically complete, with the triumphant return of RÃ¡ma\\nand his rescued queen to AyodhyÃ¡ and his consecration and coronation in\\nthe capital of his forefathers. Even if the story were not complete, the\\nconclusion of the last Canto of the sixth Book, evidently the work of a\\nlater hand than VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadkiâ\\x80\\x99s, which speaks of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s glorious and happy reign\\nand promises blessings to those who read and hear the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan, would be\\nsufficient to show that, when these verses were added, the poem was\\nconsidered to be finished. The UttarakÃ¡á¹\\x87á¸\\x8da or Last Book is merely an\\nappendix or a supplement and relates only events antecedent and subsequent\\nto those described in the original poem. Indian scholars however, led by\\nreverential love of tradition, unanimously ascribe this Last Book to\\nVÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki, and regard it as part of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan.\\n\\nSignor Gorresio has published an excellent translation of the UttarakÃ¡á¹\\x87á¸\\x8da,\\nin Italian prose, from the recension current in Bengal;(1030) and Mr. Muir\\nhas epitomized a portion of the book in the Appendix to the Fourth Part of\\nhis Sanskrit Texts (1862). From these scholars I borrow freely in the\\nfollowing pages, and give them my hearty thanks for saving me much\\nwearisome labour.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfter RÃ¡ma had returned to AyodhyÃ¡ and taken possession of the throne,\\nthe rishis [saints] assembled to greet him, and Agastya, in answer to his\\nquestions recounted many particulars regarding his old enemies. In the\\nKrita Yuga (or Golden Age) the austere and pious Brahman rishi Pulastya, a\\nson of BrahmÃ¡, being teased with the visits of different damsels,\\nproclaimed that any one of them whom he again saw near his hermitage\\nshould become pregnant. This had not been heard by the daughter of the\\nroyal rishi Triá¹\\x87avindu, who one day came into Pulastyaâ\\x80\\x99s neighbourhood,\\nand her pregnancy was the result (Sect. 2, vv. 14 ff.). After her return\\nhome, her father, seeing her condition, took her to Pulastya, who accepted\\nher as his wife, and she bore a son who received the name of ViÅ\\x9bravas.\\nThis son was, like his father, an austere and religious sage. He married\\nthe daughter of the muni BharadvÃ¡ja, who bore him a son to whom BrahmÃ¡\\ngave the name of VaiÅ\\x9bravaá¹\\x87-Kuvera (Sect. 3, vv. 1 ff.). He performed\\nausterities for thousands of years, when he obtained from BrahmÃ¡ as a boon\\nthat he should be one of the guardians of the world (along with Indra,\\nVaruá¹\\x87a, and YÃ¡ma) and the god of riches. He afterwards consulted his\\nfather ViÅ\\x9bravas about an abode, and at his suggestion took possession of\\nthe city of LankÃ¡, which had formerly been built by ViÅ\\x9bvakarmÃ¡n for the\\nRÃ¡kshasas, but had been abandoned by them through fear of Vishá¹\\x87u, and was\\nat that time unoccupied. RÃ¡ma then (Sect. 4) says he is surprised to hear\\nthat LankÃ¡ had formerly belonged to the RÃ¡kshasas, as he had always\\nunderstood that they were the descendants of Pulastya, and now he learns\\nthat they had also another origin. He therefore asks who was their\\nancestor, and what fault they had committed that they were chased away by\\nVishá¹\\x87u. Agastya replies that when BrahmÃ¡ created the waters, he formed\\ncertain beings,â\\x80\\x94some of whom received the name of RÃ¡kshasas,â\\x80\\x94to guard\\nthem. The first RÃ¡kshasas kings were Heti and Praheti. Heti married a\\nsister of KÃ¡la (Time). She bore him a son VidyutkeÅ\\x9ba, who in his turn took\\nfor his wife Lankatanka[t.]Ã¡, the daughter of SandhyÃ¡ (V. 21). She bore\\nhim a son SukeÅ\\x9ba, whom she abandoned, but he was seen by Å\\x9aiva as he was\\npassing by with his wife PÃ¡rvatÃ\\xad, who made the child as old as his mother,\\nand immortal, and gave him a celestial city. SukeÅ\\x9ba married a GandharvÃ\\xad\\ncalled DevavatÃ\\xad who bore three sons, MÃ¡lyavat, SumÃ¡li and MÃ¡li. These sons\\npractised intense austerities, when BrahmÃ¡ appeared and conferred on them\\ninvincibility and long life. They then harassed the gods. ViÅ\\x9bvakarmÃ¡ gave\\nthem a city, LankÃ¡, on the mountain TrikÃºá¹\\xada, on the shore of the southern\\nocean, which he had built at the command of Indra.â\\x80¦ The three RÃ¡kshasa,\\nMÃ¡lyavat and his two brothers, then began to oppress the gods, rishis,\\netc.; who (Sect. 6, v. 1 ff.) in consequence resort for aid to MahÃ¡deva,\\nwho having regard to his protÃ©gÃ© SukeÅ\\x9ba the father of MÃ¡lyavat, says that\\nhe cannot kill the RÃ¡kshasas, but advises the suppliants to go to Vishá¹\\x87u,\\nwhich they do, and receive from him a promise that he will destroy their\\nenemies. The three RÃ¡kshasa kings, hearing of this, consult together, and\\nproceed to heaven to attack the gods. Vishá¹\\x87u prepares to meet them. The\\nbattle is described in the seventh section. The RÃ¡kshasas are defeated by\\nVishá¹\\x87u with great slaughter, and driven back to LankÃ¡, one of their\\nleaders, MÃ¡li, being slain. MÃ¡lyavat remonstrates with Vishá¹\\x87u, who was\\nassaulting the rear of the fugitives, for his unwarrior-like conduct, and\\nwishes to renew the combat (Sect. 8, v. 3 ff.). Vishá¹\\x87u replies that he\\nmust fulfil his promise to the gods by slaying the RÃ¡kshasas, and that he\\nwould destroy them even if they fled to PÃ¡tÃ¡la. These RÃ¡kshasas, Agastya\\nsays, were more powerful than RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a, and, could only be destroyed by\\nNÃ¡rÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a, _i.e._ by RÃ¡ma himself, the eternal, indestructible god. SumÃ¡li\\nwith his family lived for along time in PÃ¡tÃ¡la, while Kuvera dwelt in\\nLankÃ¡. In section 9 it is related that SumÃ¡li once happened to visit the\\nearth, when he observed Kuvera going in his chariot to see his father\\nViÅ\\x9bravas. This leads him to consider how he might restore his own\\nfortunes. He consequently desires his daughter KaikasÃ\\xad to go and woo\\nViÅ\\x9bravas, who receives her graciously. She becomes the mother of the\\ndreadful RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a, of the huge Kumbhakará¹\\x87a, of Å\\x9aÃºrpaá¹\\x87akhÃ¡, and of the\\nrighteous Vibhishaá¹\\x87a, who was the last son. These children grow up in the\\nforest. Kumbhakará¹\\x87a goes about eating rishis. Kuvera comes to visit his\\nfather, when KaikasÃ\\xad takes occasion to urge her son RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a to strive to\\nbecome like his brother (Kuvera) in splendour. This RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a promises to do.\\nHe then goes to the hermitage of Gokarna with his brothers to perform\\nausterity. In section 10 their austere observances are described: after a\\nthousand yearsâ\\x80\\x99 penance RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a throws his head into the fire. He repeats\\nthis oblation nine times after equal intervals, and is about to do it the\\ntenth time, when BrahmÃ¡ appears, and offers a boon. RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a asks\\nimmortality, but is refused. He then asks that he may be indestructible by\\nall creatures more powerful than men; which boon is accorded by BrahmÃ¡\\ntogether with the recovery of all the heads he had sacrificed and the\\npower of assuming any shape he pleased. Vibhishaá¹\\x87a asks as his boon that\\neven amid the greatest calamities he may think only of righteousness, and\\nthat the weapon of BrahmÃ¡ may appear to him unlearnt, etc. The god grants\\nhis request, and adds the gift of immortality. When BrahmÃ¡ is about to\\noffer a boon to Kumbhakará¹\\x87a, the gods interpose, as, they say, he had\\neaten seven Apsarases and ten followers of Indra, besides rishis and men;\\nand beg that under the guise of a boon stupefaction may be inflicted on\\nhim. BrahmÃ¡ thinks on SarasvatÃ\\xad, who arrives and, by BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s command,\\nenters into Kumbhakará¹\\x87aâ\\x80\\x99s mouth that she may speak for him. Under this\\ninfluence he asks that he may receive the boon of sleeping for many years,\\nwhich is granted. When however SarasvatÃ\\xad has left him, and he recovers his\\nown consciousness, he perceives that he has been deluded. Kuvera by his\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s advice, gives up the city of LankÃ¡ to RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87.â\\x80\\x9d(1031) RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a\\nmarries (Sect. 12) MandodarÃ\\xad the beautiful daughter of the Asur Maya whose\\nname has several times occurred in the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan as that of an artist of\\nwonderful skill. She bears a son MeghanÃ¡da or the Roaring Cloud who was\\nafterwards named IndrajÃ\\xadt from his victory over the sovereign of the\\nskies. The conquest of Kuvera, and the acquisition of the magic\\nself-moving chariot which has done much service in the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan, form the\\nsubject of sections XIII., XIV. and XV. â\\x80\\x9cThe rather pretty story of\\nVedavatÃ\\xad is related in the seventeenth section, as follows: RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a in the\\ncourse of his progress through the world, comes to the forest on the\\nHimÃ¡laya, where he sees a damsel of brilliant beauty, but in ascetic garb,\\nof whom he straightway becomes enamoured. He tells her that such an\\naustere life is unsuited to her youth and attractions, and asks who she is\\nand why she is leading an ascetic existence. She answers that she is\\ncalled VedavatÃ\\xad, and is the vocal daughter of Vá¹\\x9bihaspatiâ\\x80\\x99s son, the rishi\\nKuÅ\\x9badhwaja, sprung from him during his constant study of the Veda. The\\ngods, gandharvas, etc., she says, wished that she should choose a husband,\\nbut her father would give her to no one else than to Vishá¹\\x87u, the lord of\\nthe world, whom he desired for his son-in-law. VedavatÃ\\xad then proceeds: â\\x80\\x98In\\norder that I may fulfil this desire of my father in respect of NÃ¡rÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a, I\\nwed him with my heart. Having entered into this engagement I practise\\ngreat austerity. NÃ¡rÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a and no other than he, Purushottama, is my\\nhusband. From the desire of obtaining him, I resort to this severe\\nobservance.â\\x80\\x99 RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87aâ\\x80\\x99s passion is not in the least diminished by this\\nexplanation and he urges that it is the old alone who should seek to\\nbecome distinguished by accumulating merit through austerity, prays that\\nshe who is so young and beautiful shall become his bride; and boasts that\\nhe is superior to Vishá¹\\x87u. She rejoins that no one but he would thus\\ncontemn that deity. On receiving this reply he touches the hair of her\\nhead with the tip of his finger. She is greatly incensed, and forthwith\\ncuts off her hair and tells him that as he has so insulted her, she cannot\\ncontinue to live, but will enter into the fire before his eyes. She goes\\non â\\x80\\x98Since I have been insulted in the forest by thee who art\\nwicked-hearted, I shall be born again for thy destruction. For a man of\\nevil desire cannot be slain by a woman; and the merit of my austerity\\nwould be lost if I were to launch a curse against thee. But if I have\\nperformed or bestowed or sacrificed aught may I be born the virtuous\\ndaughter, not produced from the womb, of a righteous man.â\\x80\\x99 Having thus\\nspoken she entered the blazing fire. Then a shower of celestial flowers\\nfell (from every part of the sky). It is she, lord, who, having been\\nVedavatÃ\\xad in the Krita age, has been born (in the Treta age) as the\\ndaughter of the king of the Janakas, and (has become) thy [RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s] bride;\\nfor thou art the eternal Vishá¹\\x87u. The mountain-like enemy who was\\n[virtually] destroyed before by her wrath, has now been slain by her\\nhaving recourse to thy superhuman energy.â\\x80\\x9d On this the commentator\\nremarks: â\\x80\\x9cBy this it is signified that SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ was the principal cause of\\nRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87aâ\\x80\\x99s death; but the function of destroying him is ascribed to RÃ¡ma.â\\x80\\x9d\\nOn the words, â\\x80\\x9cthou art Vishá¹\\x87u,â\\x80\\x9d in the preceding verse the same\\ncommentator remarks: â\\x80\\x9cBy this it is clearly affirmed that SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ was\\nLakshmÃ\\xad.â\\x80\\x9d This is what ParÃ¡Å\\x9bara says: â\\x80\\x9cIn the godâ\\x80\\x99s life as RÃ¡ma, she\\nbecame SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, and in his birth as Krishá¹\\x87a [she became] RukminÃ\\xad.â\\x80\\x9d(1032)\\n\\nIn the following section (XVIII.) â\\x80\\x9cRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a is described as violently\\ninterrupting a sacrifice which is being performed by king Marutta, and the\\nassembled gods in terror assume different shapes to escape; Indra becomes\\na peacock, YÃ¡ma a crow, Kuvera a lizard, and Varuá¹\\x87a a swan; and each deity\\nbestows a boon on the animal he had chosen. The peacockâ\\x80\\x99s tail recalls\\nIndraâ\\x80\\x99s thousand eyes; the swanâ\\x80\\x99s colour becomes white, like the foam of\\nthe ocean (Varuá¹\\x87a being its lord); the lizard obtains a golden colour; and\\nthe crow is never to die except when killed by a violent death, and the\\ndead are to enjoy the funeral oblations when they have been devoured by\\nthe crows.â\\x80\\x9d(1033)\\n\\nRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 then attacks Arjuna or KÃ¡rttavÃ\\xadrya the mighty king of MÃ¡hishmati on\\nthe banks of the NarmadÃ¡, and is defeated, captured and imprisoned by\\nArjuna. At the intercession of Pulastya (Sect. XXII.) he is released from\\nhis bonds. He then visits KishkindhÃ¡ where he enters into alliance with\\nBÃ¡li the King of the VÃ¡nars: â\\x80\\x9cWe will have all things in common,â\\x80\\x9d says\\nRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87, â\\x80\\x9cdames, sons, cities and kingdoms, food, vesture, and all\\ndelights.â\\x80\\x9d His next exploit is the invasion of the kingdom of departed\\nspirits and his terrific battle with the sovereign YÃ¡ma. The poet in his\\ndescription of these regions with the detested river with waves of blood,\\nthe dire lamentations, the cries for a drop of water, the devouring worm,\\nall the tortures of the guilty and the somewhat insipid pleasures of the\\njust, reminds one of the scenes in the under world so vividly described by\\nHomer, Virgil, and Dante. YÃ¡ma is defeated (Sect. XXVI.) by the giant, not\\nso much by his superior power as because at the request of BrahmÃ¡ YÃ¡ma\\nrefrains from smiting with his deadly weapon the RÃ¡kshas enemy to whom\\nthat God had once given the promise that preserved him. In the\\ntwenty-seventh section RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 goes â\\x80\\x9cunder the earth into PÃ¡tÃ¡la the\\ntreasure-house of the waters inhabited by swarms of serpents and Daityas,\\nand well defended by Varuá¹\\x87.â\\x80\\x9d He subdues BhogavatÃ\\xad the city ruled by VÃ¡suki\\nand reduces the NÃ¡gas or serpents to subjection. He penetrates even to the\\nimperial seat of Varuá¹\\x87. The God himself is absent, but his sons come forth\\nand do battle with the invader. The giant is victorious and departs\\ntriumphant. The twenty-eighth section gives the details of a terrific\\nbattle between RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 and MÃ¡ndhÃ¡tÃ¡ King of AyodhyÃ¡, a distinguished\\nancestor of RÃ¡ma. Supernatural weapons are employed on both sides and the\\nissue of the conflict is long doubtful. But at last MÃ¡ndhÃ¡tÃ¡ prepares to\\nuse the mighty weapon â\\x80\\x9cacquired by severe austerities through the grace\\nand favour of Rudra.â\\x80\\x9d The giant would inevitably have been slain. But two\\npre-eminent Munis Pulastya and GÃ¡lava beheld the fight through the power\\ngiven by contemplation, and with words of exhortation they parted King\\nMÃ¡ndhÃ¡tÃ¡ and the sovereign of the RÃ¡kshases. RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 at last (Sect. XXXII.)\\nreturns homeward carrying with him in his car Pushpak the virgin daughters\\nof kings, of Rishis, of Daityas, and Gandharvas whom he has seized upon\\nhis way. The thirty-sixth section describes a battle with Indra, in which\\nthe victorious MeghanÃ¡da son of the giant, makes the King of the Gods his\\nprisoner, binds him with his magic art, and carries him away (Sect.\\nXXVII.) in triumph to LankÃ¡. BrahmÃ¡ intercedes (Sect. XXXVIII.) and\\nIndrajÃ\\xadt releases his prisoner on obtaining in return the boon that\\nsacrifice to the Lord of Fire shall always make him invincible in the\\ncoming battle. In sections XXXIX., XL, â\\x80\\x9cwe have a legend related to RÃ¡ma\\nby the sage Agastya to account for the stupendous strength of the monkey\\nHanumÃ¡n, as it had been described in the _RÃ¡mÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a_. Rama naturally\\nwonders (as perhaps many readers of the _RÃ¡mÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a_ have done since) why a\\nmonkey of such marvellous power and prowess had not easily overcome BÃ¡li\\nand secured the throne for his friend SugrÃ\\xadva. Agastya replies that\\nHanumÃ¡n was at that time under a curse from a Rishi, and consequently was\\nnot conscious of his own might.â\\x80\\x9d(1034) The whole story of the marvellous\\nVÃ¡nar is here given at length, but nothing else of importance is added to\\nthe tale already given in the RÃ¡mÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a. The Rishis or saints then (Sect.\\nXL.) return to their celestial seats, and the VÃ¡nars, RÃ¡kshases and bears\\nalso (Sect. XLIII.) take their departure. The chariot Pushpak is restored\\nto its original owner Kuvera, as has already been related in the RÃ¡mÃ¡yaá¹\\x87.\\n\\nThe story of RÃ¡ma and SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ is then continued, and we meet with matter of\\nmore human interest. The winter is past and the pleasant spring-time is\\ncome, and RÃ¡ma and SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ sit together in the shade of the AÅ\\x9boka trees happy\\nas Indra and Å\\x9aachÃ\\xad when they drink in Paradise the nectar of the Gods.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell me, my beloved,â\\x80\\x9d says RÃ¡ma, â\\x80\\x9cfor thou wilt soon be a mother, hast\\nthou a wish in thy heart for me to gratify?â\\x80\\x9d And SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ smiles and answers:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI long, O son of Raghu, to visit the pure and holy hermitages on the\\nbanks of the Ganges and to venerate the feet of the saints who there\\nperform their rigid austerities and live on roots and berries. This is my\\nchief desire, to stand within the hermitsâ\\x80\\x99 grove were it but for a single\\nday.â\\x80\\x9d And RÃ¡ma said: â\\x80\\x9cLet not the thought trouble thee: thou shalt go to\\nthe grove of the ascetics.â\\x80\\x9d But slanderous tongues have been busy in\\nAyodhyÃ¡, and SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ has not been spared. RÃ¡ma hears that the people are\\nlamenting his blind folly in taking back to his bosom the wife who was so\\nlong a captive in the palace of RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87. RÃ¡ma well knows her spotless purity\\nin thought, word, and deed, and her perfect love of him; but he cannot\\nendure the mockery and the shame and resolves to abandon his unsuspecting\\nwife. He orders the sad but still obedient Lakshmaá¹\\x87 to convey her to the\\nhermitage which she wishes to visit and to leave her there, for he will\\nsee her face again no more. They arrive at the hermitage, and Lakshmaá¹\\x87\\ntells her all. She falls fainting on the ground, and when she recovers her\\nconsciousness sheds some natural tears and bewails her cruel and\\nundeserved lot. But she resolves to live for the sake of RÃ¡ma and her\\nunborn son, and she sends by Lakshmaá¹\\x87 a dignified message to the husband\\nwho has forsaken her: â\\x80\\x9cI grieve not for myself,â\\x80\\x9d she says â\\x80\\x9cbecause I have\\nbeen abandoned on account of what the people say, and not for any evil\\nthat I have done. The husband is the God of the wife, the husband is her\\nlord and guide; and what seems good unto him she should do even at the\\ncost of her life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSÃ\\xadtÃ¡ is honourably received by the saint VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki himself, and the holy\\nwomen of the hermitage are charged to entertain and serve her. In this\\ncalm retreat she gives birth to two boys who receive the names of KuÅ\\x9ba and\\nLava. They are carefully brought up and are taught by VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki himself to\\nrecite the RÃ¡mÃ¡yaá¹\\x87. The years pass by: and RÃ¡ma at length determines to\\ncelebrate the AÅ\\x9bvamedha or Sacrifice of the Steed. VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki, with his two\\nyoung pupils, attends the ceremony, and the unknown princes recite before\\nthe delighted father the poem which recounts his deeds. RÃ¡ma inquires into\\ntheir history and recognizes them as his sons. SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ is invited to return\\nand solemnly affirm her innocence before the great assembly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut SÃ\\xadtÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s heart was too full; this second ordeal was beyond even her\\npower to submit to, and the poet rose above the ordinary Hindu level of\\nwomen when he ventured to paint her conscious purity as rebelling:\\nâ\\x80\\x98Beholding all the spectators, and clothed in red garments, SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ clasping\\nher hands and bending low her face, spoke thus in a voice choked with\\ntears: â\\x80\\x9cas I, even in mind, have never thought of any other than RÃ¡ma, so\\nmay MÃ¡dhavÃ\\xad the goddess of Earth, grant me a hiding-place.â\\x80\\x9d As SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ made\\nthis oath, lo! a marvel appeared. Suddenly cleaving the earth, a divine\\nthrone of marvellous beauty rose up, borne by resplendent dragons on their\\nheads: and seated on it, the goddess of Earth, raising SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ with her arm,\\nsaid to her, â\\x80\\x9cWelcome to thee!â\\x80\\x9d and placed her by her side. And as the\\nqueen, seated on the throne, slowly descended to Hades, a continuous\\nshower of flowers fell down from heaven on her head.â\\x80\\x99(1035)â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBoth the great Hindu epics thus end in disappointment and sorrow. In the\\n_MahÃ¡bhÃ¡rata_ the five victorious brothers abandon the hardly won throne\\nto die one by one in a forlorn pilgrimage to the HimÃ¡laya; and in the same\\nway RÃ¡ma only regains his wife, after all his toils, to lose her. It is\\nthe same in the later Homeric cycleâ\\x80\\x94the heroes of the _Iliad_ perish by\\nill-fated deaths. And even Ulysses, after his return to Ithaca, sets sail\\nagain to Thesprotia, and finally falls by the hand of his own son. But in\\nIndia and Greece alike this is an afterthought of a self-conscious time,\\nwhich has been subsequently added to cast a gloom on the strong\\ncheerfulness of the heroic age.â\\x80\\x9d(1036)\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe termination of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s terrestrial career is thus told in Sections 116\\nff. of the UttarakÃ¡á¹\\x87da. Time, in the form of an ascetic, comes to his\\npalace gate, and asks, as the messenger of the great rishi (BrahmÃ¡) to see\\nRÃ¡ma. He is admitted and received with honour, but says, when he is asked\\nwhat he has to communicate, that his message must be delivered in private,\\nand that any one who witnesses the interview is to lose his life. RÃ¡ma\\ninforms Lakshmaá¹\\x87 of all this, and desires him to stand outside. Time then\\ntells RÃ¡ma that he has been sent by BrahmÃ¡, to say that when he (RÃ¡ma,\\n_i.e._ Vishá¹\\x87u) after destroying the worlds was sleeping on the ocean, he\\nhad formed him (BrahmÃ¡) from the lotus springing from his navel, and\\ncommitted to him the work of creation; that he (BrahmÃ¡) had then entreated\\nRÃ¡ma to assume the function of Preserver, and that the latter had in\\nconsequence become Vishá¹\\x87u, being born as the son of Aditi, and had\\ndetermined to deliver mankind by destroying RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a, and to live on earth\\nten thousand and ten hundred years; that period, adds Time, was now on the\\neve of expiration, and RÃ¡ma could either at his pleasure prolong his stay\\non earth, or ascend to heaven and rule over the gods. RÃ¡ma replies, that\\nhe had been born for the good of the three worlds, and would now return to\\nthe place whence he had come, as it was his function to fulfil the\\npurposes of the gods. While they are speaking the irritable rishi DurvÃ¡sas\\ncomes, and insists on seeing RÃ¡ma immediately, under a threat, if refused,\\nof cursing RÃ¡ma and all his family.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLakshmaá¹\\x87, preferring to save his kinsman, though knowing that his own\\ndeath must be the consequence of interrupting the interview of RÃ¡ma with\\nTime, enters the palace and reports the rishiâ\\x80\\x99s message to RÃ¡ma. RÃ¡ma\\ncomes out, and when DurvÃ¡sas has got the food he wished, and departed,\\nRÃ¡ma reflects with great distress on the words of Time, which require that\\nLakshmaá¹\\x87 should die. Lakshmaá¹\\x87 however exhorts RÃ¡ma not to grieve, but to\\nabandon him and not break his own promise. The counsellors concurring in\\nthis advice, RÃ¡ma abandons Lakshmaá¹\\x87, who goes to the river SarayÃº,\\nsuppresses all his senses, and is conveyed bodily by Indra to heaven. The\\ngods are delighted by the arrival of the fourth part of Vishá¹\\x87u. RÃ¡ma then\\nresolves to install Bharata as his successor and retire to the forest and\\nfollow Lakshmaá¹\\x87. Bharata however refuses the succession, and determines to\\naccompany his brother. RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s subjects are filled with grief, and say they\\nalso will follow him wherever he goes. Messengers are sent to Å\\x9aatrughna,\\nthe other brother, and he also resolves to accompany RÃ¡ma; who at length\\nsets out in procession from his capital with all the ceremonial\\nappropriate to the â\\x80\\x9cgreat departure,â\\x80\\x9d silent, indifferent to external\\nobjects, joyless, with Å\\x9arÃ\\xad on his right, the goddess Earth on his left,\\nEnergy in front, attended by all his weapons in human shapes, by the Vedas\\nin the forms of BrÃ¡hmans, by the GÃ¡yatrÃ\\xad, the OmkÃ¡ra, the Vashaá¹\\xadkÃ¡ra, by\\nrishis, by his women, female slaves, eunuchs, and servants. Bharata with\\nhis family, and Å\\x9aatrughna, follow together with BrÃ¡hmans bearing the\\nsacred fire, and the whole of the people of the country, and even with\\nanimals, etc., etc. RÃ¡ma, with all these attendants, comes to the banks of\\nthe SarayÃº. BrahmÃ¡, with all the gods and innumerable celestial cars, now\\nappears, and all the sky is refulgent with the divine splendour. Pure and\\nfragrant breezes blow, a shower of flowers falls. RÃ¡ma enters the waters\\nof the SarayÃº; and BrahmÃ¡ utters a voice from the sky, saying: â\\x80\\x9cApproach,\\nVishá¹\\x87u; RÃ¡ghava, thou hast happily arrived, with thy godlike brothers.\\nEnter thine own body as Vishá¹\\x87u or the eternal ether. For thou art the\\nabode of the worlds: no one comprehends thee, the inconceivable and\\nimperishable, except the large-eyed MÃ¡yÃ¡ thy primeval spouse.â\\x80\\x9d Hearing\\nthese words, RÃ¡ma enters the glory of Vishá¹\\x87u with his body and his\\nfollowers. He then asks BrahmÃ¡ to find an abode for the people who had\\naccompanied him from devotion to his person, and BrahmÃ¡ appoints them a\\ncelestial residence accordingly.(1037)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nADDITIONAL NOTES.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQueen Fortune.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA curious festival is celebrated in honour of this divinity (LakshmÃ®) on\\nthe fifth lunar day of the light half of the month MÃ¢gha (February), when\\nshe is identified with SaraswatÃ\\xad the consort of BrahmÃ¡, and the goddess of\\nlearning. In his treatise on festivals, a great modern authority,\\nRaghunandana, mentions, on the faith of a work called\\n_Samvatsara-sandipa_, that LakshmÃ® is to be worshipped in the forenoon of\\nthat day with flowers, perfumes, rice, and water; that due honour is to be\\npaid to inkstand and writing-reed, and no writing to be done. Wilson, in\\nhis essay on the _Religious Festivals of the Hindus_ (works, vol. ii, p.\\n188. ff.) adds that on the morning of the 2nd February, the whole of the\\npens and inkstands, and the books, if not too numerous and bulky, are\\ncollected, the pens or reeds cleaned, the inkstands scoured, and the books\\nwrapped up in new cloth, are arranged upon a platform, or a sheet, and\\nstrewn over with flowers and blades of young barley, and that no flowers\\nexcept white are to be offered. After performing the necessary rites, â\\x80¦\\nall the members of the family assemble and make their prostrations; the\\nbooks, the pens, and ink having an entire holiday; and should any\\nemergency require a written communication on the day dedicated to the\\ndivinity of scholarship, it is done with chalk or charcoal upon a black or\\nwhite board.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCHAMBERSâ\\x80\\x99S ENCYCLOPÃ\\x86DIA. _LakshmÃ®_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndra.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Hindu Jove or Jupiter Tonans, chief of the secondary deities.

He is the personification of the preserving\\npower, and became incarnate in nine different forms, for the preservation\\nof mankind in various emergencies. Before the creation of the universe,\\nand after its temporary annihilation, he is supposed to sleep on the\\nwaters, floating on the serpent Å\\x9aesha, and is then identified with\\nNÃ¡rÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a. BrahmÃ¡, the creator, is fabled to spring at that time from a\\nlotus which grows from his navel, whilst thus asleep.â\\x80¦ His ten avatÃ¡rs or\\nincarnations are:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c1. The Matsya, or fish. In this avatÃ¡r Vishá¹\\x87u descended in the form of a\\nfish to save the pious king Satyavrata, who with the seven Rishis and\\ntheir wives had taken refuge in the ark to escape the deluge which then\\ndestroyed the earth. 2, The KÃºrma, or Tortoise. In this he descended in\\nthe form of a tortoise, for the purpose of restoring to man some of the\\ncomforts lost during the flood. To this end he stationed himself at the\\nbottom of the ocean, and allowed the point of the great mountain Mandara\\nto be placed upon his back, which served as a hard axis, whereon the gods\\nand demons, with the serpent VÃ¡suki twisted round the mountain for a rope,\\nchurned the waters for the recovery of the amrita or nectar, and fourteen\\nother sacred things. 3. The VarÃ¡ha, or Boar. In this he descended in the\\nform of a boar to rescue the earth from the power of a demon called\\nâ\\x80\\x98golden-eyed,â\\x80\\x99 Hiraá¹\\x87yÃ¡ksha. This demon had seized on the earth and carried\\nit with him into the depths of the ocean. Vishá¹\\x87u dived into the abyss, and\\nafter a contest of a thousand years slew the monster. 4. The Narasinha, or\\nMan-lion. In this monstrous shape of a creature half-man, half-lion,\\nVishá¹\\x87u delivered the earth from the tyranny of an insolent demon called\\nHiraá¹\\x87yakaÅ\\x9bipu. 5. VÃ¡mana, or Dwarf. This avatÃ¡r happened in the second age\\nof the HindÃºs or TretÃ¡yug, the four preceding are said to have occurred in\\nthe first or Satyayug; the object of this avatÃ¡r was to trick Bali out of\\nthe dominion of the three worlds. Assuming the form of a wretched dwarf he\\nappeared before the king and asked, as a boon, as much land as he could\\npace in three steps. This was granted; and Vishá¹\\x87u immediately expanding\\nhimself till he filled the world, deprived Bali at two steps of heaven and\\nearth, but in consideration of some merit, left PÃ¡tÃ¡la still in his\\ndominion. 6. ParaÅ\\x9burÃ¡ma. 7. RÃ¡mchandra. 8. Krishá¹\\x87a, or according to some\\nBalarÃ¡ma. 9. Buddha. In this avatÃ¡r Vishá¹\\x87u descended in the form of a sage\\nfor the purpose of making some reform in the religion of the Brahmins, and\\nespecially to reclaim them from their proneness to animal sacrifice. Many\\nof the HindÃºs will not allow this to have been an incarnation of their\\nfavourite god. 10. Kalki, or White Horse. This is yet to come. Vishá¹\\x87u\\nmounted on a white horse, with a drawn scimitar, blazing like a comet,\\nwill, according to prophecy, end this present age, viz. the fourth or\\nKaliyug, by destroying the world, and then renovating creation by an age\\nof purity.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWILLIAMâ\\x80\\x99S DICTIONARY. _Vishá¹\\x87u._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSiva.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA celebrated HindÃº God, the Destroyer of creation, and therefore the most\\nformidable of the HindÃº Triad. He also personifies reproduction, since the\\nHindÃº philosophy excludes the idea of total annihilation without\\nsubsequent regeneration. Hence he is sometimes confounded with BrahmÃ¡, the\\ncreator or first person of the Triad. He is the particular God of the\\nTÃ¡ntrikas, or followers of the books called Tantras. His worshippers are\\ntermed Å\\x9aaivas, and although not so numerous as the Vaishá¹\\x87avas, exalt their\\ngod to the highest place in the heavens, and combine in him many of the\\nattributes which properly belong to the other deities. According to them\\nÅ\\x9aiva is Time, Justice, Fire, Water, the Sun, the Destroyer and Creator. As\\npresiding over generation, his type is the Linga, or Phallus, the origin\\nprobably of the Phallic emblem of Egypt and Greece. As the God of\\ngeneration and justice, which latter character he shares with the god\\nYama, he is represented riding a white bull. His own colour, as well as\\nthat of the bull, is generally white, referring probably to the unsullied\\npurity of Justice. His throat is dark-blue; his hair of a light reddish\\ncolour, and thickly matted together, and gathered above his head like the\\nhair of an ascetic. He is sometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with\\nfour, eight, or ten, and with five faces. He has three eyes, one being in\\nthe centre of his forehead, pointing up and down. These are said to denote\\nhis view of the three divisions of time, past, present, and future. He\\nholds a trident in his hand to denote, as some say, his relationship to\\nwater, or according to others, to show that the three great attributes of\\nCreator, Destroyer, and Regenerator are combined in him. His loins are\\nenveloped in a tigerâ\\x80\\x99s skin. In his character of Time, he not only\\npresides over its extinction, but also its astronomical regulation. A\\ncrescent or half-moon on his forehead indicates the measure of time by the\\nphases of the moon; a serpent forms one of his necklaces to denote the\\nmeasure of time by years, and a second necklace of human skulls marks the\\nlapse and revolution of ages, and the extinction and succession of the\\ngenerations of mankind. He is often represented as entirely covered with\\nserpents, which are the emblems of immortality. They are bound in his\\nhair, round his neck, wrists, waist, arms and legs; they serve as rings\\nfor his fingers, and earrings for his ears, and are his constant\\ncompanions. Å\\x9aiva has more than a thousand names which are detailed at\\nlength in the sixty-ninth chapter of the Å\\x9aiva PurÃ¡á¹\\x87a.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94WILLIAMSâ\\x80\\x99S\\nDICTIONARY, _Å\\x9aiva_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApsarases.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOriginally these deities seem to have been personifications of the\\nvapours which are attracted by the sun, and form into mist or clouds:\\ntheir character may be thus interpreted in the few hymns of the Rigveda\\nwhere mention is made of them. At a subsequent period when the Gandharva\\nof the Rigveda who personifies there especially the Fire of the Sun,\\nexpanded into the Fire of Lightning, the rays of the moon and other\\nattributes of the elementary life of heaven as well as into pious acts\\nreferring to it, the Apsarasas become divinities which represent phenomena\\nor objects both of a physical and ethical kind closely associated with\\nthat life; thus in the _Yajurveda_ Sunbeams are called the Apsarasas\\nassociated with the Gandharva who is the Sun; Plants are termed the\\nApsarasas connected with the Gandharva Fire: Constellations are the\\nApsarasas of the Gandharva Moon: Waters the Apsarasas of the Gandharva\\nWind, etc. etc.â\\x80¦ In the last Mythological epoch when the Gandharvas have\\nsaved from their elementary nature merely so much as to be musicians in\\nthe paradise of Indra, the Apsarasas appear among other subordinate\\ndeities which share in the merry life of Indraâ\\x80\\x99s heaven, as the wives of\\nthe Gandharvas, but more especially as wives of a licentious sort, and\\nthey are promised therefore, too, as a reward to heroes fallen in battle\\nwhen they are received in the paradise of Indra; and while, in the\\nRigveda, they assist Soma to pour down his floods, they descend in the\\nepic literature on earth merely to shake the virtue of penitent Sages and\\nto deprive them of the power they would otherwise have acquired through\\nunbroken austerities.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94GOLDSTÃ\\x9cCKERâ\\x80\\x99S _Sanskrit Dictionary_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVishnuâ\\x80\\x99s Incarnation As RÃ¡ma.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere is described one of the _avatÃ¡rs_, descents or manifestations of\\nVishá¹\\x87u in a visible form. The word _avatÃ¡r_ signifies literally _descent_.\\nThe _avatÃ¡r_ which is here spoken of, that in which, according to Indian\\ntraditions, Vishá¹\\x87u descended and appeared upon earth in the corporeal form\\nof RÃ¡ma, the hero of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yana, is the seventh in the series of Indian\\n_avatÃ¡rs_. Much has been said before now of these avatÃ¡rs, and through\\ndeficient knowledge of the ideas and doctrines of India, they have been\\ncompared to the sublime dogma of the Christian Incarnation. This is one of\\nthe grossest errors that ignorance of the ideas and beliefs of a people\\nhas produced. Between the _avatÃ¡rs_ of India and the Christian Incarnation\\nthere is such an immensity of difference that it is impossible to find any\\nreasonable analogy that can approximate them. The idea of the _avatÃ¡rs_ is\\nintimately united with that of the TrimÃºrti; the bond of connection\\nbetween these two ideas is an essential notion common to both, the notion\\nof Vishá¹\\x87u. What is the TrimÃºrti? I have already said that it is composed\\nof three Gods, BrahmÃ¡ (masculine), Vishá¹\\x87u the God of _avatÃ¡rs_, and Å\\x9aiva.\\nThese three Gods, who when reduced to their primitive and most simple\\nexpression are but three cosmogonical personifications, three powers or\\nforces of nature, these Gods, I say, are here found, according to Indian\\ndoctrines, entirely external to the true God of India, or Brahma in the\\nneuter gender. Brahma is alone, unchangeable in the midst of creation: all\\nemanates from him, he comprehends all, but he remains extraneous to all:\\nhe is Being and the negation of beings. Brahma is never worshipped; the\\nindeterminate Being is never invoked; he is inaccessible to the prayers as\\nthe actions of man; humanity, as well as nature, is extraneous to him.\\nExternal to Brahma rises the TrimÃºrti, that is to say, BrahmÃ¡ (masculine)\\nthe power which creates, Vishá¹\\x87u the power which preserves, and Å\\x9aiva the\\npower which destroys: theogony here commences at the same time with\\ncosmogony. The three divinities of the TrimÃºrti govern the phenomena of\\nthe universe and influence all nature. The real God of India is by himself\\nwithout power; real efficacious power is attributed only to three\\ndivinities who exist externally to him. BrahmÃ¡, Vishá¹\\x87u, and Å\\x9aiva,\\npossessed of qualities in part contradictory and attributes that are\\nmutually exclusive, have no other accord or harmony than that which\\nresults from the power of things itself, and which is found external to\\ntheir own thoughts. Such is the Indian TrimÃºrti. What an immense\\ndifference between this Triad and the wonderful Trinity of Christianity!\\nHere there is only one God, who created all, provides for all, governs\\nall. He exists in three Persons equal to one another, and intimately\\nunited in one only infinite and eternal substance. The Father represents\\nthe eternal thought and the power which created, the Son infinite love,\\nthe Holy Spirit universal sanctification. This one and triune God\\ncompletes by omnipotent power the great work of creation which, when it\\nhas come forth from His hands, proceeds in obedience to the laws which He\\nhas given it, governed with certain order by His infinite providence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe immense difference between the TrimÃºrti of India and the Christian\\nTrinity is found again between the _avatÃ¡rs_ of Vishá¹\\x87u and the Incarnation\\nof Christ. The _avatÃ¡r_ was effected altogether externally to the Being\\nwho is in India regarded as the true God. The manifestation of one\\nessentially cosmogonical divinity wrought for the most part only material\\nand cosmogonical prodigies. At one time it takes the form of the gigantic\\ntortoise which sustains Mount Mandar from sinking in the ocean; at another\\nof the fish which raises the lost Veda from the bottom of the sea, and\\nsaves mankind from the waters. When these _avatÃ¡rs_ are not cosmogonical\\nthey consist in some protection accorded to men or Gods, a protection\\nwhich is neither universal nor permanent. The very manner in which the\\n_avatÃ¡r_ is effected corresponds to its material nature, for instance the\\nmysterious vase and the magic liquor by means of which the _avatÃ¡r_ here\\nspoken of takes place. What are the forms which Vishá¹\\x87u takes in his\\ndescents? They are the simple forms of life; he becomes a tortoise, a\\nboar, a fish, but he is not obliged to take the form of intelligence and\\nliberty, that is to say, the form of man. In the _avatÃ¡r_ of Vishá¹\\x87u is\\ndiscovered the inpress of pantheistic ideas which have always more or less\\nprevailed in India. Does the _avatÃ¡r_ produce a permanent and definitive\\nresult in the world? By no means. It is renewed at every catastrophe\\neither of nature or man, and its effects are only transitory.â\\x80¦ To sum up\\nthen, the Indian _avatÃ¡r_ is effected externally to the true God of India,\\nto Brahma; it has only a cosmogonical or historical mission which is\\nneither lasting nor decisive; it is accomplished by means of strange\\nprodigies and magic transformations; it may assume promiscuously all the\\nforms of life; it may be repeated indefinitely. Now let the whole of this\\nIndian idea taken from primitive tradition be compared with the\\nIncarnation of Christ and it will be seen that there is between the two an\\nirreconcilable difference. According to the doctrines of Christianity the\\nEverlasting Word, Infinite Love, the Son of God, and equal to Him, assumed\\na human body, and being born as a man accomplished by his divine act the\\ngreat miracle of the spiritual redemption of man. His coming had for its\\nsole object to bring erring and lost humanity back to Him; this work being\\naccomplished, and the divine union of men with God being re-established,\\nredemption is complete and remains eternal.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe superficial study of India produced in the last century many\\nerroneous ideas, many imaginary and false parallels between Christianity\\nand the Brahmanical religion. A profounder knowledge of Indian\\ncivilization and religion, and philological studies enlarged and guided by\\nmore certain principles have dissipated one by one all those errors. The\\nattributes of the Christian God, which by one of those intellectual\\nerrors, which Vico attributes to the vanity of the learned, had been\\ntransferred to Vishá¹\\x87u, have by a better inspired philosophy been reclaimed\\nfor Christianity, and the result of the two religions, one immovable and\\npowerless, the other diffusing itself with all its inherent force and\\nenergy, has shown further that there is a difference, a real opposition,\\nbetween the two principles.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94GORRESIO.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKusa and Lava.\\n\\n\\nAs the story of the banishment of SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ and the subsequent birth in\\nVÃ¡lmÃ\\xadkiâ\\x80\\x99s hermitage of KuÅ\\x9ba and Lava the rhapsodists of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan, is\\nintimately connected with the account in the introductory cantos of\\nVÃ¡lmÃ\\xadkiâ\\x80\\x99s composition of the poem, I shall, I trust, be pardoned for\\nextracting it from my rough translation of KÃ¡lidÃ¡saâ\\x80\\x99s Raghuvaá¹\\x87Å\\x9ba, parts\\nonly of which have been offered to the public.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, day by day, the husbandâ\\x80\\x99s hope grew high,\\nGazing with love on SÃ\\xadtÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s melting eye:\\nWith anxious care he saw her pallid cheek,\\nAnd fondly bade her all her wishes speak.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnce more I fain would see,â\\x80\\x9d the lady cried,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe sacred groves that rise on GangÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s side,\\nWhere holy grass is ever fresh and green,\\nAnd cattle feeding on the rice are seen:\\nThere would I rest awhile, where once I strayed\\nLinked in sweet friendship to each hermit maid.â\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd RÃ¡ma smiled upon his wife, and sware,\\nWith many a tender oath, to grant her prayer.\\nIt chanced, one evening, from a lofty seat\\nHe viewed AyodhyÃ¡ stretched before his feet:\\nHe looked with pride upon the royal road\\nLined with gay shops their glittering stores that showed,\\nHe looked on SarjÃºâ\\x80\\x99s silver waves, that bore\\nThe light barks flying with the sail and oar;\\nHe saw the gardens near the town that lay,\\nFilled with glad citizens and boys at play.\\nThen swelled the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s bosom with delight,\\nAnd his heart triumphed at the happy sight.\\nHe turned to Bhadra, standing by his side,â\\x80\\x94\\nUpon whose secret news the king relied.â\\x80\\x94\\nAnd bade him say what people said and thought\\nOf all the exploits that his arm had wrought.\\nThe spy was silent, but, when questioned still,\\nThus spake, obedient to his masterâ\\x80\\x99s will:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor all thy deeds in peace and battle done\\nThe people praise thee, King, except for one:\\nThis only act of all thy life they blame,â\\x80\\x94\\nThy welcome home of her, thy ravished dame.â\\x80\\x9d\\nLike iron yielding to the ironâ\\x80\\x99s blow,\\nSank RÃ¡ma, smitten by those words of woe.\\nHis breast, where love and fear for empire vied,\\nSwayed, like a rapid swing, from side to side.\\nShall he this rumour scorn, which blots his life,\\nOr banish her, his dear and spotless wife?\\nBut rigid Duty left no choice between\\nHis perilled honour and his darling queen.\\nCalled to his side, his brothers wept to trace\\nThe marks of anguish in his altered face.\\nNo longer bright and glorious as of old,\\nHe thus addressed them when the tale was told:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlas! my brothers, that my life should blot\\nThe fame of those the Sun himself begot:\\nAs from the labouring cloud the driven rain\\nLeaves on the mirrorâ\\x80\\x99s polished face a stain.\\nEâ\\x80\\x99en as an elephant who loathes the stake\\nAnd the strong chain he has no power to break,\\nI cannot brook this cry on every side,\\nThat spreads like oil upon the moving tide.\\nI leave the daughter of Videhaâ\\x80\\x99s King,\\nAnd the fair blossom soon from her to spring,\\nAs erst, obedient to my sireâ\\x80\\x99s command,\\nI left the empire of the sea-girt land.\\nGood is my queen, and spotless; but the blame\\nIs hard to bear, the mockery and the shame.\\nMen blame the pure Moon for the darkened ray,\\nWhen the black shadow takes the light away.\\nAnd, O my brothers, if ye wish to see\\nRÃ¡ma live long from this reproach set free,\\nLet not your pity labour to control\\nThe firm sad purpose of his changeless soul.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  Thus RÃ¡ma spake.

praise.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBeloved brother,â\\x80\\x9d thus the monarch cried\\nTo his dear Lakshmaá¹\\x87, whom he called aside.â\\x80\\x94\\nLakshmaá¹\\x87, who knew no will save his alone\\nWhose hero deeds through all the world were known:â\\x80\\x94\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy queen has told me that she longs to rove\\nBeneath the shade of Saint VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadkiâ\\x80\\x99s grove:\\nNow mount thy car, away my lady bear;\\nTell all, and leave her in the forest there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  The car was brought, the gentle lady smiled,\\nAs the glad news her trusting heart beguiled.\\nShe mounted up: Sumantra held the reins;\\nAnd forth the coursers bounded oâ\\x80\\x99er the plains.\\nShe saw green fields in all their beauty dressed,\\nAnd thanked her husband in her loving breast.\\nAlas! deluded queen! she little knew\\nHow changed was he whom she believed so true;\\nHow one she worshipped like the Heavenly Tree\\nCould, in a momentâ\\x80\\x99s time, so deadly be.\\nHer right eye throbbed,â\\x80\\x94ill-omened sign, to tell\\nThe endless loss of him she loved so well,\\nAnd to the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s saddening heart revealed\\nThe woe that Lakshmaá¹\\x87, in his love, concealed.\\nPale grew the bloom of her sweet face,â\\x80\\x94as fade\\nThe lotus blossoms,â\\x80\\x94by that sign dismayed.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, may this omen,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94was her silent prayer,â\\x80\\x94\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo grief to RÃ¡ma or his brothers bear!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  When Lakshmaá¹\\x87, faithful to his brother, stood\\nPrepared to leave her in the distant wood,\\nThe holy GangÃ¡, flowing by the way,\\nRaised all her hands of waves to bid him stay.\\nAt length with sobs and burning tears that rolled\\nDown his sad face, the kingâ\\x80\\x99s command he told;\\nAs when a monstrous cloud, in evil hour,\\nRains from its labouring womb a stony shower.\\nShe heard, she swooned, she fell upon the earth,\\nFell on that bosom whence she sprang to birth.\\nAs, when the tempest in its fury flies,\\nLow in the dust the prostrate creeper lies,\\nSo, struck with terror sank she on the ground,\\nAnd all her gems, like flowers, lay scattered round.\\nBut Earth, her mother, closed her stony breast,\\nAnd, filled with doubt, denied her daughter rest.\\nShe would not think the Chief of Raghuâ\\x80\\x99s race\\nWould thus his own dear guiltless wife disgrace.\\nStunned and unconscious, long the lady lay,\\nAnd felt no grief, her senses all astray.\\nBut gentle Lakshmaá¹\\x87, with a brotherâ\\x80\\x99s care,\\nBrought back her sense, and with her sense, despair.\\nBut not her wrongs, her shame, her grief, could wring\\nOne angry word against her lord the King:\\nUpon herself alone the blame she laid,\\nFor tears and sighs that would not yet be stayed.\\nTo soothe her anguish Lakshmaá¹\\x87 gently strove;\\nHe showed the path to Saint VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadkiâ\\x80\\x99s grove;\\nAnd craved her pardon for the share of ill\\nHe wrought, obedient to his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s will.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO, long and happy, dearest brother, live!\\nI have to praise,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9cand not forgive:\\nTo do his will should be thy noblest praise;\\nAs Vishá¹\\x87u ever Indraâ\\x80\\x99s will obeys.\\nReturn, dear brother: on each royal dame\\nBestow a blessing in poor SÃ\\xadtÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s name,\\nAnd bid them, in their love, kind pity take\\nUpon her offspring, for the fatherâ\\x80\\x99s sake.\\nAnd speak my message in the monarchâ\\x80\\x99s ear,\\nThe last last words of mine that he shall hear:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSay, was it worthy of thy noble race\\nThy guiltless queen thus lightly to disgrace?\\nFor idle tales to spurn thy faithful bride,\\nWhose constant truth the searching fire had tried?\\nOr may I hope thy soul refused consent,\\nAnd but thy voice decreed my banishment?\\nHope that no care could turn, no love could stay\\nThe lightning stroke that falls on me to-day?\\nThat sins committed in the life thatâ\\x80\\x99s fled\\nHave brought this evil on my guilty head?\\nThink not I value now my widowed life,\\nWorthless to her who once was RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s wife.\\nI only live because I hope to see\\nThe dear dear babe that will resemble thee.\\nAnd then my task of penance shall be done,\\nWith eyes uplifted to the scorching sun;\\nSo shall the life that is to come restore\\nMine own dear husband, to be lost no more.â\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd Lakshmaá¹\\x87 swore her every word to tell,\\nThen turned to go, and bade the queen farewell.\\nAlone with all her woes, her piteous cries\\nRose like a butchered lambâ\\x80\\x99s that struggling dies.\\nThe reverend sage who from his dwelling came\\nFor sacred grass and wood to feed the flame,\\nHeard her loud shrieks that rent the echoing wood,\\nAnd, quickly following, by the mourner stood.\\nBefore the sage the lady bent her low,\\nDried her poor eyes, and strove to calm her woe.\\nWith blessings on her hopes the blameless man\\nIn silver tones his soothing speech began:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFirst of all faithful wives, O Queen, art thou;\\nAnd can I fail to mourn thy sorrows now?\\nRest in this holy grove, nor harbour fear\\nWhere dwell in safety eâ\\x80\\x99en the timid deer.\\nHere shall thine offspring safely see the light,\\nAnd be partaker of each holy rite.\\nHere, near the hermitsâ\\x80\\x99 dwellings, shall thou lave\\nThy limbs in Tonseâ\\x80\\x99s sin-destroying wave,\\nAnd on her isles, by prayer and worship, gain\\nSweet peace of mind, and rest from care and pain.\\nEach hermit maiden with her sweet soft voice,\\nShall soothe thy woe, and bid thy heart rejoice:\\nWith fruit and early flowers thy lap shall fill,\\nAnd offer grain that springs for us at will.\\nAnd here, with labour light, thy task shall be\\nTo water carefully each tender tree,\\nAnd learn how sweet a nursing motherâ\\x80\\x99s joy\\nEre on thy bosom rest thy darling boy.â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThat very night the banished

SÃ\\xadtÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s children, by the saintâ\\x80\\x99s command,\\nSang the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan, wandering through the land.\\nHow could the glorious poem fail to gain\\nEach heart, each ear that listened to the strain!\\nSo sweet each minstrelâ\\x80\\x99s voice who sang the praise\\nOf RÃ¡ma deathless in VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadkiâ\\x80\\x99s lays.\\nRÃ¡ma himself amid the wondering throng\\nMarked their fair forms,

marvelled as they praised;\\nFor every eye amid the throng could trace\\nRÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s own image in each youthful face.\\nThen spoke the king himself and bade them say\\nWho was their teacher,

In India\\nFate was rather an inevitable consequence of actions done in births\\nantecedent to oneâ\\x80\\x99s present state of existence, and was therefore\\nconnected with the doctrine of metempsychosis.

In\\nBengal, the domestic god is sometimes the _SÃ¡lagrÃ¡m_ stone, sometimes the\\n_tulasi_ plant, sometimes a basket with a little rice in it, and sometimes\\na water-jarâ\\x80\\x94to either of which a brief adoration is daily addressed, most\\nusually by the females of the family. Occasionally small images of Lakshmi\\nor Chaá¹\\x87di fulfil the office, or should a snake appear, he is venerated as\\nthe guardian of the dwelling. In general, however, in former times, the\\nhousehold deities were regarded as the unseen spirits of ill, the ghosts\\nand goblins who hovered about every spot, and claimed some particular\\nsites as their own.

but the allusion\\nthat RÃ¡ma was inaugurated by _VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha_ and the other BrÃ¡hmanas in the\\nsame manner as Indra by the Vasus â\\x80¦ and the observation which is made in\\nsome passages that a certain rite of the inauguration was performed\\nâ\\x80\\x98according to the sacred ruleâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80¦ admit of the conclusion that the ceremony\\nwas supposed to have taken place in conformity with the vaidik\\ninjunction.â\\x80¦ As the inauguration of _RÃ¡ma_ was intended and the necessary\\npreparations for it were made when his father DaÅ\\x9baratha was still alive,\\nbut as the ceremony itself, through the intrigues of his step-mother\\n_KaikeyÃ\\xad_, did not take place then, but fourteen years later, after the\\ndeath of _DaÅ\\x9baratha_, an account of the preparatory ceremonies is given in\\nthe _AyodhyÃ¡kÃ¡á¹\\x87á¸\\x8da_ (Book II) as well as in the _Yuddha-KÃ¡á¹\\x87á¸\\x8da_ (Book VI.)\\nof the RÃ¡mÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a, but an account of the complete ceremony in the latter\\nbook alone. According to the _AyodhyÃ¡kÃ¡á¹\\x87á¸\\x8da_, on the day preceding the\\nintended inauguration _RÃ¡ma_ and his wife _SÃ\\xadtÃ¡_ held a fast, and in the\\nnight they performed this preliminary rite: _RÃ¡ma_ having made his\\nablutions, approached the idol of _NÃ¡rÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a_, took a cup of clarified\\nbutter, as the religious law prescribes, made a libation of it into the\\nkindled fire, and drank the remainder while wishing what was agreeable to\\nhis heart. Then, with his mind fixed on the divinity he lay, silent and\\ncomposed, together with _SÃ\\xadtÃ¡_, on a bed of KuÅ\\x9ba-grass, which was spread\\nbefore the altar of Vishá¹\\x87u, until the last watch of the night, when he\\nawoke and ordered the palace to be prepared for the solemnity. At\\nday-break reminded of the time by the voices of the bards, he performed\\nthe usual morning devotion and praised the divinity. In the meantime the\\ntown AyodhyÃ¡ had assumed a festive appearance and the inauguration\\nimplements had been arranged â\\x80¦ golden water-jars, an ornamented\\nthrone-seat, a chariot covered with a splendid tiger-skin, water taken\\nfrom the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna, as well as from other sacred\\nrivers, tanks, wells, lakes, and from all oceans, honey, curd, clarified\\nbutter, fried grain, KuÅ\\x9ba-grass, flowers, milk; besides, eight beautiful\\ndamsels, and a splendid furious elephant, golden and silver jars, filled\\nwith water, covered with _Udumbara_ branches and various lotus flowers,\\nbesides a white jewelled _chourie_, a white splendid parasol, a white\\nbull, a white horse, all manner of musical instruments and bards.â\\x80¦ In the\\npreceding chapter â\\x80¦ there are mentioned _two_ white _chouries_ instead of\\none, and all kinds of seeds, perfumes and jewels, a scimitar, a bow, a\\nlitter, a golden vase, and a blazing fire, and amongst the living\\nimplements of the pageant, instead of the bards, gaudy courtesans, and\\nbesides the eight damsels, professors of divinity, BrÃ¡hmaá¹\\x87as, cows and\\npure kinds of wild beasts and birds, the chiefs of town and country-people\\nand the citizens with their train.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 109.\\n\\n\\n_Then with the royal chaplains they_\\n_Took each his place in long array._\\n\\n_The twice born chiefs, with zealous heed,_\\n_Made ready what the rite would need._\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow about the office of a Purohita (house priest).

In his battles with Vritra he is therefore described as â\\x80\\x98opening\\nthe receptacles of the waters,â\\x80\\x99 as â\\x80\\x98cleaving the cloudâ\\x80\\x99 with his\\nâ\\x80\\x98far-whirling thunderbolt,â\\x80\\x99 as â\\x80\\x98casting the waters down to earth,â\\x80\\x99 and\\nâ\\x80\\x98restoring the sun to the sky.â\\x80\\x99 He is in consequence â\\x80\\x98the upholder of\\nheaven, earth, and firmament,â\\x80\\x99 and the god â\\x80\\x98who has engendered the sun and\\nthe dawn.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d CHAMBERSâ\\x80\\x99S CYCLOPÃ\\x86DIA, _Indra_.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThroughout these hymns two images stand out before us with overpowering\\ndistinctness.

Chap. 15. â\\x80\\x9cAfterwards the Munis beheld a great\\ndust arise, and they said to the people who were nigh: â\\x80\\x98What is this?â\\x80\\x99 And\\nthe people answered and said: â\\x80\\x98Now that the kingdom is without a king, the\\ndishonest men have begun to seize the property of their neighbours. The\\ngreat dust that you behold, excellent Munis, is raised by troops of\\nclustering robbers, hastening to fall upon their prey.â\\x80\\x99 The sages, hearing\\nthis, consulted, and together rubbed the thigh of the king (Vena), who had\\nleft no offspring, to produce a son. From the thigh, thus rubbed, came\\nforth a being of the complexion of a charred stake, with flattened\\nfeatures like a negro, and of dwarfish stature. â\\x80\\x98What am I to do,â\\x80\\x99 cried\\nhe eagerly to the Munis. â\\x80\\x98Sit down (nishÃ\\xadda),â\\x80\\x99 said they. And thence his\\nname was NishÃ¡da. His descendants, the inhabitants of the VindhyÃ¡\\nmountain, great Muni, are still called NishÃ¡das and are characterized by\\nthe exterior tokens of depravity.â\\x80\\x9d Professor Wilson adds, in his note on\\nthe passage: â\\x80\\x9cThe Matsya says that there were born outcast or barbarous\\nraces, Mlechchhas, as black as collyrium. The BhÃ¡gavata describes an\\nindividual of dwarfish stature, with short arms and legs, of a complexion\\nas black as a crow, with projecting chin, broad flat nose, red eyes, and\\ntawny hair, whose descendants were mountaineers and foresters. The Padma\\n(BhÃºmi Khaá¹\\x87á¸\\x8da) has a similar deccription; adding to the dwarfish stature\\nand black complexion, a wide mouth, large ears, and a protuberant belly.\\nIt also particularizes his posterity as NishÃ¡das, KirÃ¡tas, Bhillas, and\\nother barbarians and Mlechchhas, living in woods and on mountains. These\\npassages intend, and do not much exaggerate, the uncouth appearance of the\\nGonds, Koles, Bhils, and other uncivilized tribes, scattered along the\\nforests and mountains of Central India from Behar to Khandesh, and who\\nare, not improbably, the predecessors of the present occupants of the\\ncultivated portions of the country. They are always very black,\\nill-shapen, and dwarfish, and have countenances of a very African\\ncharacter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nManu gives a different origin of the NishÃ¡das as the offspring of a\\nBrÃ¡hman father and a SÃºdra mother.

Bharatâ\\x80\\x99s Return.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwo routes from AyodhyÃ¡ to RÃ¡jagriha or Girivraja are described. That\\ntaken by the envoys appears to have been the shorter one, and we are not\\ntold why Bharat returned by a different road. The capital of the Kekayas\\nlay to the west of the VipÃ¡Å\\x9bÃ¡. Between it and the Å\\x9aatadru stretched the\\ncountry of the BÃ¡hÃ\\xadkas. Upon the remaining portion of the road the two\\nrecensions differ. According to that of Bengal there follow towards the\\neast the river IndamatÃ\\xad, then the town AjakÃ¡la belonging to the Bodhi,\\nthen BhulingÃ¡, then the river Å\\x9aaradaá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dÃ¡. According to the other instead of\\nthe first river comes the IkshumatÃ\\xad â\\x80¦ instead of the first town AbhikÃ¡la,\\ninstead of the second KulingÃ¡, then the second river. According to the\\ndirection of the route both the above-mentioned rivers must be tributaries\\nof the Å\\x9aatadrÃº.â\\x80¦ The road then crossed the YamunÃ¡ (Jumna), led beyond that\\nriver through the country of the PanchÃ¡las, and reached the Ganges at\\nHÃ¡stinapura, where the ferry was. Thence it led over the RÃ¡magangÃ¡ and its\\neastern tributaries, then over the Gomati, and then in a southern\\ndirection along the MÃ¡lini, beyond which it reached AyodhyÃ¡. In Bharatâ\\x80\\x99s\\njourney the following rivers are passed from west to east: _Kutikoshá¹\\xadikÃ¡_,\\n_UttÃ¡nikÃ¡_, _Kuá¹\\xadikÃ¡_, _KapÃ\\xadvatÃ\\xad_, _GomatÃ\\xad_ according to Schlegel, and\\n_Hiraá¹\\x87yavatÃ\\xad_, _UttÃ¡rikÃ¡_, _Kuá¹\\xadilÃ¡_, _KapÃ\\xadvatÃ\\xad_, _GomatÃ\\xad_ according to\\nGorresio. As these rivers are to be looked for on the east of the Ganges,\\nthe first must be the modern _Koh_, a small affluent of the RÃ¡magangÃ¡,\\nover which the highway cannot have gone as it bends too far to the north.\\nThe UttÃ¡nikÃ¡ or UttÃ¡rikÃ¡ must be the RÃ¡magangÃ¡, the Kuá¹\\xadikÃ¡ or Kuá¹\\xadilÃ¡ its\\neastern tributary, KoÅ\\x9bilÃ¡, the KapÃ\\xadvatÃ\\xad the next tributary which on the\\nmaps has different names, _Gurra_ or above Kailas, lower down _Bhaigu_.\\nThe GomatÃ\\xad (Goomtee) retains its old name. The MÃ¡linÃ\\xad, mentioned only in\\nthe envoysâ\\x80\\x99 journey, must have been the western tributary of the SarayÃº\\nnow called ChukÃ¡.â\\x80\\x9d LASSENâ\\x80\\x99S _Indische Alterthumskunde_, Vol. II.

At the same\\ntime, however, the story throws some light upon the significance of the\\npoem, and upon the character in which the Brahmanical author desired to\\nrepresent RÃ¡ma; and consequently it deserves more serious consideration\\nthan the nature of the subject-matter would otherwise seem to imply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAccording to the RÃ¡mÃ¡yana, the hero RÃ¡ma spent more than thirteen years\\nof his exile in wandering amongst the different Brahmanical settlements,\\nwhich appear to have been scattered over the country between the Ganges\\nand the GodÃ¡veri; his wanderings extending from the hill of Chitra-kÃºá¹\\xada in\\nBundelkund, to the modern town of Nasik on the western side of India, near\\nthe source of the GodÃ¡veri river, and about seventy-five miles to the\\nnorth-west of Bombay. The appearance of these Brahmanical hermitages in\\nthe country far away to the south of the Raj of Kasala, seems to call for\\ncritical inquiry. Each hermitage is said to have belonged to some\\nparticular sage, who is famous in Brahmanical tradition. But whether the\\nsages named were really contemporaries of RÃ¡ma, or whether they could\\npossibly have flourished at one and the same period, is open to serious\\nquestion. It is of course impossible to fix with any degree of certainty\\nthe relative chronology of the several sages, who are said to have been\\nvisited by RÃ¡ma; but still it seems tolerably clear that some belonged to\\nan age far anterior to that in which the RÃ¡mÃ¡yana was composed, and\\nprobably to an age anterior to that in which RÃ¡ma existed as a real and\\nliving personage; whilst, at least, one sage is to be found who could only\\nhave existed in the age during which the RÃ¡mÃ¡yana was produced in its\\npresent form. The main proofs of these inferences are as follows. An\\ninterval of many centuries seems to have elapsed between the composition\\nof the Rig-Veda and that of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yana: a conclusion which has long been\\nproved by the evidence of language, and is generally accepted by Sanskrit\\nscholars. But three of the sages, said to have been contemporary with\\nRÃ¡ma, namely, ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra, Atri and Agastya, are frequently mentioned in\\nthe hymns of the Rig-Veda; whilst VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki, the sage dwelling at\\nChitra-kÃºá¹\\xada, is said to have been himself the composer of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yana.\\nAgain, the sage Atri, whom RÃ¡ma visited immediately after his departure\\nfrom Chitra-kÃºá¹\\xada, appears in the genealogical list preserved in the MahÃ¡\\nBhÃ¡rata, as the progenitor of the Moon, and consequently as the first\\nancestor of the Lunar race: whilst his grandson Buddha [Budha] is said to\\nhave married IlÃ¡, the daughter of IkhsvÃ¡ku who was himself the remote\\nancestor of the Solar race of AyodhyÃ¡, from whom RÃ¡ma was removed by many\\ngenerations. These conclusions are not perhaps based upon absolute proof,\\nbecause they are drawn from untrustworthy authorities; but still the\\nchronological difficulties have been fully apprehended by the Pundits, and\\nan attempt has been made to reconcile all contradictions by representing\\nthe sages to have lived thousands of years, and to have often re-appeared\\nupon earth in different ages widely removed from each other. Modern\\nscience refuses to accept such explanations; and consequently it is\\nimpossible to escape the conclusion that if VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki composed the RÃ¡mÃ¡yana\\nin the form of Sanskrit in which it has been preserved, he could not have\\nflourished in the same age as the sages who are named in the Rig-Veda.â\\x80\\x9d\\nWHEELERâ\\x80\\x99S _History of India, Vol._ II, 229.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 249.\\n\\n\\n_And King HimÃ¡layaâ\\x80\\x99s Child._\\n\\nUmÃ¡ or PÃ¡rvatÃ\\xad, was the daughter of HimÃ¡laya and MenÃ¡.

UrvasÃ\\xad.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe personification of UrvasÃ® herself is as thin as that of EÃ´s or\\nSelÃªnÃª. Her name is often found in the Veda as a mere name for the\\nmorning, and in the plural number it is used to denote the dawns which\\npassing over men bring them to old age and death. UrvasÃ® is the bright\\nflush of light overspreading the heaven before the sun rises, and is but\\nanother form of the many mythical beings of Greek mythology whose names\\ntake us back to the same idea or the same root. As the dawn in the Vedic\\nhymns is called UrÃ»kÃ®, the far-going (TÃªlephassa, TÃªlephos), so is she\\nalso UruasÃ®, the wide-existing or wide-spreading; as are EurÃ´pÃª,\\nEuryanassa, Euryphassa, and many more of the sisters of AthÃªnÃª and\\nAphroditÃª. As such she is the mother of Vasishtha, the bright being, as\\nOidipous is the son of IokastÃª; and although Vasishtha, like Oidipous, has\\nbecome a mortal bard or sage, he is still the son of Mitra and Varuá¹\\x87a, of\\nnight and day. Her lover PurÃ»ravas is the counterpart of the Hellenic\\nPolydeukÃªs; but the continuance of her union with him depends on the\\ncondition that she never sees him unclothed. But the Gandharvas, impatient\\nof her long sojourn among mortal men resolved to bring her back to their\\nbright home; and PurÃ»ravas is thus led unwitingly to disregard her\\nwarning. A ewe with two lambs was tied to her couch, and the Gandharvas\\nstole one of them; UrvasÃ® said, â\\x80\\x98They take away my darling, as if I lived\\nin a land where there is no hero and no man.â\\x80\\x99 They stole the second, and\\nshe upbraided her husband again. Then PurÃ»ravas looked and said, â\\x80\\x98How can\\nthat be a land without heroes or men where I am?â\\x80\\x99 And naked he sprang up;\\nhe thought it was too long to put on his dress. Then the Gandharvas sent a\\nflash of lighting, and UrvasÃ® saw her husband naked as by daylight. Then\\nshe vanished. â\\x80\\x98I come back,â\\x80\\x99 she said, and went. â\\x80\\x98Then he bewailed his\\nvanished love in bitter grief.â\\x80\\x99 Her promise to return was fulfilled, but\\nfor a moment only, at the Lotos-lake, and PurÃ»ravas in vain beseeches her\\nto tarry longer. â\\x80\\x98What shall I do with thy speech?â\\x80\\x99 is the answer of\\nUrvasÃ®. â\\x80\\x98I am gone like the first of the dawns. PurÃ»ravas, go home again.\\nI am hard to be caught like the winds.â\\x80\\x99 Her lover is in utter despair; but\\nwhen he lies down to die, the heart of UrvasÃ® was melted, and she bids him\\ncome to her on the last night of the year. On that night only he might be\\nwith her; but a son should be born to him. On that day he went up to the\\ngolden seats, and there UrvasÃ® told him that the Gandharvas would grant\\nhim one wish, and that he must make his choice. â\\x80\\x98Choose thou for me,â\\x80\\x99 he\\nsaid: and she answered, â\\x80\\x98Say to them, Let me be one of you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCOXâ\\x80\\x99S _Mythology of the Aryan Nations._ Vol. I. p. 397.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 324.\\n\\n\\n_The sovereign of the VÃ¡nar race._\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVÃ¡nar is one of the most frequently occurring names by which the poem\\ncalls the monkeys of RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s army.

RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s Alliance With SugrÃ\\xadva.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe literal interpretation of this portion of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yana is indeed\\ndeeply rooted in the mind of the Hindu. He implicitly believes that RÃ¡ma\\nis Vishnu, who became incarnate for the purpose of destroying the demon\\nRÃ¡vana: that he permitted his wife to be captured by RÃ¡vana for the sake\\nof delivering the gods and BrÃ¡hmans from the oppressions of the RÃ¡kshasa;\\nand that he ultimately assembled an army of monkeys, who were the progeny\\nof the gods, and led them against the strong-hold of RÃ¡vana at LankÃ¡, and\\ndelivered the world from the tyrant RÃ¡kshasa, whilst obtaining ample\\nrevenge for his own personal wrongs.\\n\\nOne other point seems to demand consideration, namely, the possibility of\\nsuch an alliance as that which RÃ¡ma is said to have concluded with the\\nmonkeys. This possibility will of course be denied by modern critics, but\\nstill it is interesting to trace out the circumstances which seem to have\\nled to the acceptance of such a wild belief by the dreamy and marvel\\nloving Hindi. The south of India swarms with monkeys of curious\\nintelligence and rare physical powers. Their wonderful instinct for\\norganization, their attachment to particular localities, their occasional\\njourneys in large numbers over mountains and across rivers, their\\nobstinate assertion of supposed rights, and the ridiculous caricature\\nwhich they exhibit of all that is animal and emotional in man, would\\nnaturally create a deep impression.â\\x80¦ Indeed the habits of monkeys well\\ndeserve to be patiently studied; not as they appear in confinement, when\\nmuch that is revolting in their nature is developed, but as they appear\\nliving in freedom amongst the trees of the forest, or in the streets of\\ncrowded cities, or precincts of temples. Such a study would not fail to\\nawaken strange ideas; and although the European would not be prepared to\\nregard monkeys as sacred animals he might be led to speculate as to their\\norigin by the light of data, which are at present unknown to the\\nnaturalist whose observations have been derived from the menagerie alone.\\n\\nWhatever, however, may have been the train of ideas which led the HindÃº to\\nregard the monkey as a being half human and half divine, there can be\\nlittle doubt that in the RÃ¡mÃ¡yana the monkeys of southern India have been\\nconfounded with what may be called the aboriginal people of the country.\\nThe origin of this confusion may be easily conjectured. Perchance the\\naborigines of the country may have been regarded as a superior kind of\\nmonkeys; and to this day the features of the Marawars, who are supposed to\\nbe the aborigines of the southern part of the Carnatic, are not only\\ndifferent from those of their neighbours, but are of a character\\ncalculated to confirm the conjecture. Again, it is probable that the army\\nof aborigines may have been accompanied by outlying bands of monkeys\\nimpelled by that magpie-like curiosity and love of plunder which are the\\npeculiar characteristics of the monkey race; and this incident may have\\ngiven rise to the story that the army was composed of Monkeys.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWHEELERâ\\x80\\x99S _History of India.

The Fall Of BÃ¡li.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs regards the narrative, it certainly seems to refer to some real event\\namongst the aboriginal tribes: namely, the quarrel between an elder and\\nyounger brother for the possession of a RÃ¡j; and the subsequent alliance\\nof RÃ¡ma with the younger brother. It is somewhat remarkable that RÃ¡ma\\nappears to have formed an alliance with the wrong party, for the right of\\nBÃ¡li was evidently superior to that of SugrÃ\\xadva; and it is especially\\nworthy of note that RÃ¡ma compassed the death of BÃ¡li by an act contrary to\\nall the laws of fair fighting. Again, RÃ¡ma seems to have tacitly\\nsanctioned the transfer of TÃ¡rÃ¡ from BÃ¡li to SugrÃ\\xadva, which was directly\\nopposed to modern rule, although in conformity with the rude customs of a\\nbarbarous age; and it is remarkable that to this day the marriage of both\\nwidows and divorced women is practised by the Marawars, or aborigines of\\nthe southern Carnatic, contrary to the deeply-rooted prejudice which\\nexists against such unions amongst the HindÃºs at large.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWHEELERâ\\x80\\x99S _History of India, Vol. II. 324_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 370. The VÃ¡nar Host.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe splendid Marutas form the army of Indras, the red-haired monkeys and\\nbears that of RÃ¢mas; and the mythical and solar nature of the monkeys and\\nbears of the RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹\\x87am manifests itself several times. The king of the\\nmonkeys is a sun-god. The ancient king was named BÃ¢lin, and was the son of\\nIndras. His younger brother SugrÃ\\xadvas, he who changes his shape at pleasure\\n(KÃ¢marÃºpas), who, helped by RÃ¢mas, usurped his throne, is said to be own\\nchild of the sun. Here it is evident that the Vedic antagonism between\\nIndras and Vishá¹\\x87us is reproduced in a zoological and entirely apish form.\\nThe old Zeus must give way to the new, the moon to the sun, the evening to\\nthe morning sun, the sun of winter to that of spring; the young son\\nbetrays and overthrows the old one.â\\x80¦ RÃ¢mas, who treacherously kills the\\nold king of the monkeys, BÃ¢lin, is the equivalent of Vishá¹\\x87us, who hurls\\nhis predecessor Indras from his throne; and SugrÃ\\xadvas, the new king of the\\nmonkeys resembles Indras when he promises to find the ravished SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, in\\nthe same way as Vishá¹\\x87us in one of his incarnations finds again the lost\\nvedÃ¡s. And there are other indications in the RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹\\x87am of opposition\\nbetween Indras and the monkeys who assist RÃ¢mas. The great monkey\\nHanumant, of the reddish colour of gold, has his jaw broken, Indras having\\nstruck him with his thunderbolt and caused him to fall upon a mountain,\\nbecause, while yet a child, he threw himself off a mountain into the air\\nin order to arrest the course of the sun, whose rays had no effect upon\\nhim. (The cloud rises from the mountain and hides the sun, which is unable\\nof itself to disperse it; the tempest comes, and brings flashes of\\nlightning and thunder-bolts, which tear the cloud in pieces.)\\n\\nThe whole legend of the monkey Hanumant represents the sun entering into\\nthe cloud or darkness, and coming out of it. His father is said to be now\\nthe wind, now the elephant of the monkeys (Kapikunjaras), now KeÅ\\x9barin, the\\nlong-haired sun, the sun with a mane, the lion sun (whence his name of\\n_KeÅ\\x9bariá¹\\x87ah putrah_). From this point of view, Hanumant would seem to be\\nthe brother of SugrÃ\\xadvas, who is also the offspring of the sun.â\\x80¦\\n\\nAll the epic monkeys of the _RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹\\x87am_ are described in the twentieth\\ncanto of the first book by expressions which very closely resemble those\\napplied in the Vedic hymns to the Marutas, as swift as the tempestuous\\nwind, changing their shape at pleasure, making a noise like clouds,\\nsounding like thunder, battling, hurling mountain-peaks, shaking great\\nuprooted trees, stirring up the deep waters, crushing the earth with their\\narms, making the clouds fall. Thus BÃ¢lin comes out of the cavern as the\\nsun out of the cloud.â\\x80¦\\n\\nBut the legend of the monkey Hanumant presents another curious resemblance\\nto that of Samson. Hanumant is bound with cords by Indrajit, son of\\nRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87as; he could easily free himself, but does not wish to do so. RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87as\\nto put him to shame, orders his tail to be burned, because the tail is the\\npart most prized by monkeys.â\\x80¦\\n\\nThe tail of Hanumant, which sets fire to the city of the monsters, is\\nprobably a personification of the rays of the morning or spring sun, which\\nsets fire to the eastern heavens, and destroys the abode of the nocturnal\\nor winter monsters.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDE GUBERNATIS, _Zoological Mythology_, Vol. II. pp. 100 ff.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Jaitwas of Rajputana, a tribe politically reckoned as Rajputs,\\nnevertheless trace their descent from the monkey-god Hanuman, and confirm\\nit by alleging that their princes still bear its evidence in a tail-like\\nprolongation of the spine; a tradition which has probably a real\\nethnological meaning, pointing out the Jaitwas as of non-Aryan\\nrace.â\\x80\\x9d(1040) TYLORâ\\x80\\x99S _Primitive Culture_, Vol. I. p. 341.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 372.\\n\\n\\nThe names of peoples occurring in the following _Å\\x9blokas_ are omitted in\\nthe metrical translation:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo to the BrahmamÃ¡las,(1041) the Videhas,(1042) the MÃ¡lavas,(1043) the\\nKÃ¡Å\\x9bikoÅ\\x9balas,(1044) the MÃ¡gadnas,(1045) the Puá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dras,(1046) and the\\nAngas,(1047) and the land of the weavers of silk, and the land of the\\nmines of silver, and the hills that stretch into the sea, and the towns\\nand the hamlets that are about the top of Mandar, and the\\nKará¹\\x87aprÃ¡varaá¹\\x87as,(1048) and the Oshá¹\\xadhakará¹\\x87akas,(1049) and the\\nGhoralohamukhas,(1050) and the swift EkapÃ¡dakas,(1051) and the strong\\nimperishable Eaters of Men, and the KirÃ¡tas(1052) with stiff hair-tufts,\\nmen like gold and fair to look upon: And the Eaters of Raw Fish, and the\\nKirÃ¡tas who dwell in islands, and the fierce Tiger-men(1053) who live amid\\nthe waters.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 374.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo to the Vidarbhas(1054) and the Rishá¹\\xadikas(1055) and the\\nMahishikas,(1056) and the Matsyas(1057) and Kalingas(1058) and the\\nKauÅ\\x9bikas(1059) â\\x80¦ and the Andhras(1060) and the Puá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dras(1061) and the\\nCholas(1062) and the Paá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dyas(1063) and the Keralas,(1064) Mlechchhas(1065)\\nand the Pulindas(1066) and the Å\\x9aÃºrasenas,(1067) and the Prasthalas and the\\nBharatas and Madrakas(1068) and the KÃ¡mbojas(1069) and the Yavanas(1070)\\nand the towns of the Å\\x9aakas(1071) and the Varadas.â\\x80\\x9d(1072)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 378. Northern Kurus.\\n\\n\\nProfessor Lassen remarks in the Zeitschrift fÃ¼r die Kunde des\\nMorgenlandes, ii. 62: â\\x80\\x9cAt the furthest accessible extremity of the earth\\nappears Harivarsha with the northern Kurus. The region of Hari or Vishá¹\\x87u\\nbelongs to the system of mythical geography; but the case is different\\nwith the Uttara Kurus. Here there is a real basis of geographical fact; of\\nwhich fable has only taken advantage, without creating it. The Uttara\\nKurus were formerly quite independent of the mythical system of _dvÃ\\xadpas_,\\nthough they were included in it at an early date.â\\x80\\x9d Again the same writer\\nsays at p. 65: â\\x80\\x9cThat the conception of the Uttara Kurus is based upon an\\nactual country and not on mere invention, is proved (1) by the way in\\nwhich they are mentioned in the Vedas; (2) by the existence of Uttara Kuru\\nin historical times as a real country; and (3) by the way in which the\\nlegend makes mention of that region as the home of primitive customs. To\\nbegin with the last point the MahÃ¡bhÃ¡rata speaks as follows of the freer\\nmode of life which women led in the early world, Book I. verses 4719-22:\\nâ\\x80\\x98Women were formerly unconfined and roved about at their pleasure,\\nindependent. Though in their youthful innocence they abandoned their\\nhusbands, they were guilty of no offence; for such was the rule in early\\ntimes. This ancient custom is even now the law for creatures born as\\nbrutes, which are free from lust and anger. This custom is supported by\\nauthority and is observed by great rishis, and it is _still practiced\\namong the northern Kurus_.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe idea which is here conveyed is that of the continuance in one part of\\nthe world of that original blessedness which prevailed in the golden age.\\nTo afford a conception of the happy condition of the southern Kurus it is\\nsaid in another place (M.-Bh, i. 4346.) â\\x80\\x98The southern Kurus vied in\\nhappiness with the northern Kurus and with the divine rishis and bards.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nProfessor Lassen goes on to say: â\\x80\\x98Ptolemy (vi. 16.) is also acquainted\\nwith _Uttara Kuru_. He speaks of a mountain, a people, and a city called\\n_Ottorakorra_. Most of the other ancient authors who elsewhere mention\\nthis name, have it from him. It is a part of the country which he calls\\nSerica; according to him the city lies twelve degrees west from the\\nmetropolis of Sera, and the mountain extends from thence far to the\\neastward. As Ptolemy has misplaced the whole of eastern Asia beyond the\\nGanges, the _relative_ position which he assigns will guide us better that\\nthe absolute one, which removes _Ottorakorra_ so far to the east that a\\ncorrection is inevitable. According to my opinion the _Ottorakorra_ of\\nPtolemy must be sought for to the east of Kashgar.â\\x80\\x99 Lassen also thinks\\nthat Magasthenes had the Uttara Kurus in view when he referred to the\\nHyperboreans who were fabled by Indian writers to live a thousand years.\\nIn his Indian antiquities, (Ind. Alterthumskunde, i. 511, 512. and note,)\\nthe same writer concludes that though the passages above cited relative to\\nthe Uttara Kurus indicate a belief in the existence of a really existing\\ncountry of that name in the far north, yet that the descriptions there\\ngiven are to be taken as pictures of an ideal paradise, and not as founded\\non any recollections of the northern origin of the Kurus. It is probable,\\nhe thinks, that some such reminiscences originally existed, and still\\nsurvived in the Vedic era, though there is no trace of their existence in\\nlatter times.â\\x80\\x9d MUIRâ\\x80\\x99S _Sanskrit Texts_, Vol. II. pp. 336, 337.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 428.\\n\\n\\n_Trust to these mighty VÃ¡nars._\\n\\nThe corresponding passage in the Bengal recension has â\\x80\\x9cthese silvans in\\nthe forms of monkeys, vÃ¡narÃ¡h kapirupinah.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHere it manifestly appears,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsays Gorresio, â\\x80\\x9cthat these hosts of combatants whom RÃ¡ma led to the\\nconquest of LankÃ¡ (Ceylon) the kingdom and seat of the Hamitic race, and\\nwhom the poem calls monkeys, were in fact as I have elsewhere observed,\\ninhabitants of the mountainous and southern regions of India, who were\\nwild-looking and not altogether unlike monkeys.

Hence Agastya was regarded in ancient legend as the conqueror and\\nruler of the southern country. This tradition refers to the earliest\\nmigrations made by the Sanskrit Indians towards the south of India. To\\nAgastya are attributed many marvellous mythic deeds which adumbrate and\\nveil ancient events; some of which are alluded to here and there in the\\nRÃ¡mÃ¡yana.â\\x80\\x9d GORRESIO.\\n\\nThe following is the literal translation of the Canto, text and\\ncommentary, from the Calcutta edition:\\n\\nHaving found RÃ¡ma weary with fighting and buried in deep thought, and\\nRÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 standing before him ready to engage in battle, the holy Agastya, who\\nhad come to see the battle, approached RÃ¡ma and spoke to him thus: â\\x80\\x9cO\\nmighty RÃ¡ma, listen to the old mystery by which thou wilt conquer all thy\\nfoes in the battle.

The funeral rites are not described in detail\\nhere, and it is therefore difficult to elucidate and explain them.

They then performed an unrivalled\\nobsequial ceremony for the RÃ¡xasa prince, placing the sacrificial ground\\nto the S.E. and the fire in the proper situation. They cast the ladle\\nfilled with curds and ghee on the shoulder(1157) of the deceased; he (?)\\nplaced the car on the feet, and the mortar between the thighs. Having\\ndeposited all the wooden vessels, the [upper] and lower fire-wood, and the\\nother pestle, in their proper places, they departed. The RÃ¡xasas having\\nthen slain a victim to their prince in the manner prescribed in the\\nÅ\\x9aÃ¡stras, and enjoined by great rishis, cast [into the fire] the coverlet\\nof the king saturated with ghee. They then, VibhÃ\\xadshaá¹\\x87a included, with\\nafflicted hearts, adorned RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a with perfumes and garlands, and with\\nvarious vestments, and besprinkled him with fried grain. VibhÃ\\xadshaá¹\\x87a having\\nbathed, and having, with his clothes wet, scattered in proper form _tila_\\nseeds mixed with _darbha_ grass, and moistened with water, applied the\\nfire [to the pile].â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 496.\\n\\n\\nThe following is a literal translation of BrahmÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s address to RÃ¡ma\\naccording to the Calcutta edition, text and commentary:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO RÃ¡ma, how dost thou, being the creator of all the world, best of all\\nthose who have profound knowledge of the Upanishads and all-powerful as\\nthou art, suffer SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ to fall in the fire? How dost thou not know thyself\\nas the best of the gods? Thou art one of the primeval Vasus,(1158) and\\nalso their lord and creator. Thou art thyself the lord and first creator\\nof the three worlds. Thou art the eighth (that is MahÃ¡deva) of the\\nRudras,(1159) and also the fifth(1160) of the SÃ¡dhyas.(1161) (The poet\\ndescribes RÃ¡ma as made of the following gods) The AÅ\\x9bvinikumÃ¡ras (the twin\\ndivine physicians of the gods) are thy ears; the sun and the moon are thy\\neyes; and thou hast been seen in the beginning and at the end of creation.\\nHow dost thou neglect the daughter of Videha (Janaka} like a man whose\\nactions are directed by the dictates of nature?â\\x80\\x9d Thus addressed by Indra,\\nBrahmÃ¡ and the other gods, RÃ¡ma the descendant of Raghu, lord of the world\\nand the best of the virtuous, spoke to the chief of the gods. â\\x80\\x9cAs I take\\nmyself to be a man of the name of RÃ¡ma and son of DaÅ\\x9baratha, therefore,\\nsir, please tell me who I am and whence have I come.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cO thou whose might\\nis never failing,â\\x80\\x9d said BrahmÃ¡ to KÃ¡kutstha the foremost of those who\\nthoroughly know BrahmÃ¡, â\\x80\\x9cThou art NÃ¡rÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a,(1162) almighty, possessed of\\nfortune, and armed with the discus.

Thou art Vishá¹\\x87u (the\\npervader of all); blue in colour: of great might; the commander of armies;\\nand lord of villages. Thou art truth. Thou art embodied intelligence,\\nforgiveness, control over the senses, creation, and destruction. Thou art\\nUpendra(1167) and MadhusÃºdana.(1168) Thou art the creator of Indra, the\\nruler over all the world, PadmanÃ¡bha,(1169) and destroyer of enemies in\\nthe battle. The divine Rishis call thee shelter of refugees, as well as\\nthe giver of shelter. Thou hast a thousand horns,(1170) a hundred\\nheads.(1171) Thou art respected of the respected; and the lord and first\\ncreator of the three worlds. Thou art the forefather and shelter of\\nSiddhas,(1172) and SÃ¡dhyas.(1173) Thou art sacrifices; Vashaá¹\\xadkÃ¡ra,(1174)\\nOmkÃ¡ra.(1175) Thou art beyond those who are beyond our senses. There is\\nnone who knows who thou art and who knows thy beginning and end. Thou art\\nseen in all material objects, in BrÃ¡hmans, in cows, and also in all the\\nquarters, sky and streams. Thou hast a thousand feet, a hundred heads, and\\na thousand eyes. Thou hast borne the material objects and the earth with\\nthe mountains; and at the bottom of the ocean thou art seen the great\\nserpent. O RÃ¡ma, Thou hast borne the three worlds, gods, Gandharvas,(1176)\\nand demons. I am, O RÃ¡ma, thy heart; the goddess of learning is thy\\ntongue; the gods are the hairs of thy body; the closing of thy eyelids is\\ncalled the night: and their opening is called the day. The Vedas are thy\\nSanskÃ¡ras.(1177) Nothing can exist without thee. The whole world is thy\\nbody; the surface of the earth is thy stability.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nO Å\\x9arÃ\\xadvatsalakshaá¹\\x87a, fire is thy anger, and the moon is thy favour. In the\\ntime of thy incarnation named VÃ¡mana, thou didst pervade the three worlds\\nwith thy three steps; and Mahendra was made the king of paradise by thee\\nhaving confined the fearful Bali.(1178) SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ (thy wife) is LakshmÃ\\xad; and\\nthou art the God Vishá¹\\x87u,(1179) Krishá¹\\x87a,(1180) and PrajÃ¡pati. To kill RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87\\nthou hast assumed the form of a man; therefore, O best of the virtuous,\\nthou hast completed this task imposed by us (gods). O RÃ¡ma, RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a has\\nbeen killed by thee: now being joyful (i.e. having for some time reigned\\nin the kingdom of AyodhyÃ¡,) go to paradise. O glorious RÃ¡ma, thy power and\\nthy valour are never failing. The visit to thee and the prayers made to\\nthee are never fruitless. Thy devotees will never be unsuccessful. Thy\\ndevotees who obtain thee (thy favour) who art first and best of mankind,\\nshall obtain their desires in this world as well as in the next.

As Mr. Muir has\\nobserved, the Bengal recension which Signor Gorresio has most ably edited\\nis throughout an admirable commentary on the genuine RÃ¡mÃ¡yan of northern\\nIndia, and I have made constant reference to the faithful and elegant\\ntranslation which accompanies the text for assistance and confirmation in\\ndifficulties:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTowards the southern extremity and in the island of LankÃ¡ (Ceylon) there\\nexisted undoubtedly a black and ferocious race, averse to the Aryans and\\nhostile to their mode of worship: their ramifications extended through the\\nislands of the Archipelago, and some traces of them remain in Java to this\\nday.\\n\\nThe Sanskrit-Indians, applying to this race a name expressive of hatred\\nwhich occurs in the Vedas as the name of hostile, savage and detested\\nbeings, called it the RÃ¡kshas race: it is against these RÃ¡kshases that the\\nexpedition of RÃ¡ma which the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan celebrates is directed. The\\nSanskrit-Indians certainly altered in their traditions the real character\\nof this race: they attributed to it physical and moral qualities not found\\nin human nature; they transformed it into a race of giants; they\\nrepresented it as monstrous, hideous, truculent, changing forms at will,\\nblood-thirsty and ravenous, just as the Semites represented the races that\\nopposed them as impious, horrible and of monstrous size. But\\nnotwithstanding these mythical exaggerations, which are partly due to the\\ngenius of the Aryans so prone to magnify everything without measure, the\\nRÃ¡mÃ¡yan in the course of its epic narration has still preserved and noted\\nhere and there some traits and peculiarities of the race which reveal its\\ntrue character. It represents the RÃ¡kshases as black of hue, and compares\\nthem with black clouds and masses of black collyrium; it attributes to\\nthem curly woolly hair and thick lips, it depicts them as loaded with\\nchains, collars and girdles of gold, and the other bright ornaments which\\ntheir race has always loved, and in which the kindred races of the Soudan\\nstill delight. It describes them as worshippers of matter and force. They\\nare hostile to the religion of the Aryans whose rites and sacrifices they\\ndisturb and ruin â\\x80¦ Such is the RÃ¡kshas race as represented in the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan;\\nand the war of the Aryan RÃ¡ma forms the subject of the epic, a subject\\ncertainly real and historical as far as regards its substance, but greatly\\nexaggerated by the ancient myth. In Sanskrit-Indian tradition are found\\ntraces of another struggle of the Aryans with the RÃ¡kshas races, which\\npreceded the war of RÃ¡ma. According to some pauranic legends, KÃ¡rttavÃ\\xadrya,\\na descendant of the royal tribe of the YÃ¡davas, contemporary with\\nParasurama and a little anterior to RÃ¡ma, attacked LankÃ¡ and took RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87\\nprisoner. This well shows how ancient and how deeply rooted in the Aryan\\nrace is the thought of this war which the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan celebrates.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d says an eminent Indianist(1181) whose learning I highly appreciate,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe RÃ¡mÃ¡yan is an allegorical epic, and no precise and historical value\\ncan be assigned to it. SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ signifies the furrow made by the plough, and\\nunder this symbolical aspect has already appeared honoured with worship in\\nthe hymns of the Rig-veda; RÃ¡ma is the bearer of the plough (this\\nassertion is entirely gratuitous); these two allegorical personages\\nrepresented agriculture introduced to the southern regions of India by the\\nrace of the Kosalas from whom RÃ¡ma was descended; the RÃ¡kshases on whom he\\nmakes war are races of demons and giants who have little or nothing human\\nabout them; allegory therefore predominates in the poem, and the exact\\nreality of an historical event must not be looked for in it.â\\x80\\x9d Such is\\nProfessor Weberâ\\x80\\x99s opinion. If he means to say that mythical fictions are\\nmingled with real events,\\n\\nForsan in alcun vero suo arco percuote,\\n\\nas Dante says, and I fully concede the point. The interweaving of the myth\\nwith the historical truth belongs to the essence, so to speak, of the\\nprimitive epopeia. If SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ is born, as the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan feigns, from the furrow\\nwhich King Janak opened when he ploughed the earth, not a whit more real\\nis the origin of Helen and Ã\\x86neas as related in Homer and Virgil, and if\\nthe characters in the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan exceed human nature, and in a greater degree\\nperhaps than is the case in analogous epics, this springs in part from the\\nnature of the subject and still more from the symbol-loving genius of the\\norient. Still the characters of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan, although they exceed more or\\nless the limits of human nature, act notwithstanding in the course of the\\npoem, speak, feel, rejoice and grieve according to the natural impulse of\\nhuman passions. But if by saying that the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan is an allegorical epic,\\nit is meant that its fundamental subject is nothing but allegory, that the\\nwar of the Aryan RÃ¡ma against the RÃ¡kshas race is an allegory, that the\\nconquest of the southern region and of the island of LankÃ¡ is an allegory,\\nI do not hesitate to answer that such a presumption cannot be admitted and\\nthat the thing is in my opinion impossible. Father PaolÃ\\xadno da S.\\nBartolommeo,(1182) had already, together with other strange opinions of\\nhis own on Indian matters, brought forward a similar idea, that is to say\\nthat the exploit of RÃ¡ma which is the subject of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan was a symbol\\nand represented the course of the sun: thus he imagined that BrahmÃ¡ was\\nthe earth, Vishá¹\\x87u the water, and that his avatÃ¡rs were the blessings\\nbrought by the fertilizing waters, etc. But such ideas, born at a time\\nwhen Indo-sanskrit antiquities were enveloped in darkness, have been\\ndissipated by the light of new studies. How could an epic so dear in India\\nto the memory of the people, so deeply rooted for many centuries in the\\nminds of all, so propagated and diffused through all the dialects and\\nlanguages of those regions, which had become the source of many dramas\\nwhich are still represented in India, which is itself represented every\\nyear with such magnificence and to such crowds of people in the\\nneighbourhood of AyodhyÃ¡, a poem welcomed at its very birth with such\\nfavour, as the legend relates, that the recitation of it by the first\\nwandering Rhapsodists has consecrated and made famous all the places\\ncelebrated by them, and where RÃ¡ma made a shorter or longer stay, how, I\\nask, could such an epic have been purely allegorical? How, upon a pure\\ninvention, upon a simple allegory, could a poem have been composed of\\nabout fifty thousand verses, relating with such force and power the\\nevents, and giving details with such exactness? On a theme purely\\nallegorical there may easily be composed a short mythical poem, as for\\nexample a poem on Proserpine or Psyche: but never an epic so full of\\ntraditions and historical memories, so intimately connected with the life\\nof the people, as the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan.(1183) Excessive readiness to find allegory\\nwhenever some traces of symbolism occur, where the myth partly veils the\\nhistorical reality, may lead and often has led to error. What poetical\\nwork of mythical times could stand this mode of trial? could there not be\\nmade, or rather has there not been made a work altogether allegorical, out\\nof the Homeric poems? We have all heard of the ingenious idea of the\\nanonymous writer, who in order to prove how easily we may pass beyond the\\ntruth in our wish to seek and find allegory everywhere, undertook with\\nkeen subtlety to prove that the great personality of Napoleon I. was\\naltogether allegorical and represented the sun. Napoleon was born in an\\nisland, his course was from west to east, his twelve marshals were the\\ntwelve signs of the zodiac, etc.\\n\\nI conclude then, that the fundamental theme of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan, that is to say\\nthe war of the Aryan RÃ¡ma against the RÃ¡kshases, an Hamitic race settled\\nin the south, ought to be regarded as real and historical as far as\\nregards its substance, although the mythic element intermingled with the\\ntrue sometimes alters its natural and genuine aspect.\\n\\nHow then did the Indo-Sanskrit epopeia form and complete itself? What\\nelements did it interweave in its progress? How did it embody, how did it\\nclothe the naked and simple primitive datum? We must first of all remember\\nthat the Indo-European races possessed the epic genius in the highest\\ndegree, and that they alone in the different regions they occupied\\nproduced epic poetry â\\x80¦ But other causes and particular influences combined\\nto nourish and develop the epic germ of the Sanskrit-Indians. Already in\\nthe Rig-veda are found hymns in which the Aryan genius preluded, so to\\nspeak, to the future epopeia, in songs that celebrated the heroic deeds of\\nIndra, the combats and the victories of the tutelary Gods of the Aryan\\nraces over enemies secret or open, human or superhuman, the exploits and\\nthe memories of ancient heroes. More recently, at certain solemn\\noccasions, as the very learned A. Weber remarks, at the solemnity, for\\nexample of the AÅ\\x9bvamedha or sacrifice of the horse, the praises of the\\nking who ordained the great rite were sung by bards and minstrels in songs\\ncomposed for the purpose, the memories of past times were recalled and\\nhonourable mention was made of the just and pious kings of old. In the\\n_BrÃ¡hmaá¹\\x87as_, a sort of prose commentaries annexed to the Vedas, are found\\nrecorded stories and legends which allude to historical events of the past\\nages, to ancient memories, and to mythical events. Such popular legends\\nwhich the _BrÃ¡hmaá¹\\x87as_ undoubtedly gathered from tradition admirably suited\\nthe epic tissue with which they were interwoven by successive hands.â\\x80¦ Many\\nand various mythico-historical traditions, suitable for epic development,\\nwere diffused among the Aryan races, those for example which are related\\nin the four chapters containing the description of the earth, the Descent\\nof the Ganges, etc. The epic genius however sometimes created beings of\\nits own and gave body and life to ideal conceptions. Some of the persons\\nin the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan must be, in my opinion, either personifications of the\\nforces of nature like those which are described with such vigour in the\\n_ShÃ¡hnÃ¡mah_, or if not exactly created, exaggerated beyond human\\nproportions; others, vedic personages much more ancient than RÃ¡ma, were\\nintroduced into the epic and woven into its narrations, to bring together\\nmen who lived in different and distant ages, as has been the case in times\\nnearer to our own, in the epics, I mean, of the middle ages.\\n\\nIn the introduction I have discussed the antiquity of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan; and by\\nmeans of those critical and inductive proofs which are all that an\\nantiquity without precise historical dates can furnish I have endeavoured\\nto establish with all the certainty that the subject admitted, that the\\noriginal composition of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan is to be assigned to about the twelfth\\ncentury before the Christian era. Not that I believe that the epic then\\nsprang to life in the form in which we now possess it; I think, and I have\\nelsewhere expressed the opinion, that the poem during the course of its\\nrhapsodical and oral propagation appropriated by way of episodes,\\ntraditions, legends and ancient myths.â\\x80¦ But as far as regards the epic\\npoem properly so called which celebrates the expedition of RÃ¡ma against\\nthe RÃ¡kshases I think that I have sufficiently shown that its origin and\\nfirst appearance should be placed about the twelfth century B.C.; nor have\\nI hitherto met with anything to oppose this chronological result, or to\\noblige me to rectify or reject it.â\\x80¦ But an eminent philologist already\\nquoted, deeply versed in these studies, A. Weber, has expressed in some of\\nhis writings a totally different opinion; and the authority of his name,\\nif not the number and cogency of his arguments, compels me to say\\nsomething on the subject. From the fact or rather the assumption that\\nMegasthenes(1184) who lived some time in India has made no mention either\\nof the MahÃ¡bhÃ¡rat or the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan Professor Weber argues that neither of\\nthese poems could have existed at that time; as regards the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan, the\\nunity of its composition, the chain that binds together its different\\nparts, and its allegorical character, show it, says Professor Weber, to be\\nmuch more recent than the age to which I have assigned it, near to our own\\nera, and according to him, later than the MahÃ¡bhÃ¡rat. As for Megasthenes\\nit should be observed, that he did not write a history of India, much less\\na literary history or anything at all resembling one, but a simple\\ndescription, in great part physical, of India: whence, from his silence on\\nliterary matters to draw inferences regarding the history of Sanskrit\\nliterature would be the same thing as from the silence of a geologist with\\nrespect to the literature of a country whose valleys, mountains, and\\ninternal structure he is exploring, to conjecture that such and such a\\npoem or history not mentioned by him did not exist at his time. We have\\nonly to look at the fragments of Megasthenes collected and published by\\nSchwanbeck to see what was the nature and scope of his _Indica_.â\\x80¦ But only\\na few fragments of Megasthenes are extant; and to pretend that they should\\nbe argument and proof enough to judge the antiquity of a poem is to press\\nthe laws of criticism too far. To Professor Weberâ\\x80\\x99s argument as to the\\nmore or less recent age of the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan from the unity of its composition,\\nI will make one sole reply, which is that if unity of composition were\\nreally a proof of a more recent age, it would be necessary to reduce by a\\nthousand years at least the age of Homer and bring him down to the age of\\nAugustus and Virgil; for certainly there is much more unity of\\ncomposition, a greater accord and harmony of parts in the Iliad and the\\nOdyssey than in the RÃ¡mÃ¡yan. But in the fine arts perfection is no proof\\nof a recent age: while the experience and the continuous labour of\\nsuccessive ages are necessary to extend and perfect the physical or\\nnatural sciences, art which is spontaneous in its nature can produce and\\nhas produced in remote times works of such perfection as later ages have\\nnot been able to equal.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nINDEX

According to the _AdhyÃ¡tmÃ¡ RÃ¡mÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a_, the\\n      sage, although a BrÃ¡hman by birth, associated with foresters and\\n      robbers. Attacking on one occasion the seven Rishis, they\\n      expostulated with him successfully, and taught him the _mantra_ of\\n      RÃ¡ma reversed, or _MarÃ¡, MarÃ¡_, in the inaudible repetition of which\\n      he remained immovable for thousands of years, so that when the sages\\n      returned to the same spot they found him still there, converted into\\n      a _valmÃ\\xadk_ or ant-hill, by the nests of the termites, whence his\\n      name of VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n      WILSON. _Specimens of the Hindu Theatre, Vol. I. p. 313_.\\n\\n      â\\x80\\x9cVÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki is said to have lived a solitary life in the woods: he is\\n      called both a _muni_ and a _rishi_. The former word properly\\n      signifies an anchorite or hermit; the latter has reference chiefly\\n      to wisdom. The two words are frequently used promiscuously, and may\\n      both be rendered by the Latin _vates_ in its earliest meaning of\\n      _seer_: VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki was both poet and seer, as he is said to have sung\\n      the exploits of RÃ¡ma by the aid of divining insight rather than of\\n      knowledge naturally acquired.â\\x80\\x9d SCHLEGEL.\\n\\n    3 Literally, _Kokila_, the KoÃ¯l, or Indian Cuckoo.

Three lines under\\n      the chin like those at the mouth of a conch (_Å\\x9aaÅ\\x84kha_) were regarded\\n      as a peculiarly auspicious sign indicating, as did also the mark of\\n      Vishá¹\\x87uâ\\x80\\x99s discus on the hand, one born to be a _chakravartin_ or\\n      universal emperor. In the palmistry of Europe the line of fortune,\\n      as well as the line of life, is in the hand.

Veda is the same word which appears in\\n      the Greek Î¿á½·Î´Î±, I know, and in the English wise, wisdom, to wit. The\\n      name of Veda is commonly given to four collections of hymns, which\\n      are respectively known by the names of Rig-veda, Yajur-veda,\\n      SÃ¡ma-veda, and Atharva-veda.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n      â\\x80\\x9cAs the language of the Veda, the Sanskrit, is the most ancient type\\n      of the English of the present day, (Sanskrit and English are but\\n      varieties of one and the same language,) so its thoughts and\\n      feelings contain in reality the first roots and germs of that\\n      intellectual growth which by an unbroken chain connects our own\\n      generation with the ancestors of the Aryan race,â\\x80\\x94with those very\\n      people who at the rising and setting of the sun listened with\\n      trembling hearts to the songs of the Veda, that told them of bright\\n      powers above, and of a life to come after the sun of their own lives\\n      had set in the clouds of the evening. These men were the true\\n      ancestors of our race, and the Veda is the oldest book we have in\\n      which to study the first beginnings of our language, and of all that\\n      is embodied in language. We are by nature Aryan, Indo-European, not\\n      Semitic: our spiritual kith and kin are to be found in India,\\n      Persia, Greece, Italy, Germany: not in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or\\n      Palestine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n      _Chips from a German Workshop_, Vol. I. pp. 8. 4.\\n\\n   19 As with the ancient Persians and Scythians, Indian princes were\\n      carefully instructed in archery which stands for military science in\\n      general, of which, among Hindu heroes, it was the most important\\n      branch.\\n\\n   20 Chief of the three queens of DaÅ\\x9baratha and mother of RÃ¡ma.\\n\\n   21 From _hima_ snow, (Greek Ï\\x87ÎµÎ¹Î¼-á½½Î½, Latin hiems) and _Ã¡laya_ abode,\\n      the Mansion of snow.\\n\\n   22 The moon (_Soma_, _Indu_, _Chandra_ _etc._) is masculine with the\\n      Indians as with the Germans.\\n\\n   23 Kuvera, the Indian Plutus, or God of Wealth.\\n\\n   24 The events here briefly mentioned will be related fully in the\\n      course of the poem. The first four cantos are introductory, and are\\n      evidently the work of a later hand than Valmikiâ\\x80\\x99s.\\n\\n   25 â\\x80\\x9cChandra, or the Moon, is fabled to have been married to the\\n      twenty-seven daughters of the patriarch Daksha, or AÅ\\x9bvinÃ\\xad and the\\n      rest, who are in fact personifications of the Lunar Asterisms. His\\n      favourite amongst them was Rohiá¹\\x87Ã\\xad to whom he so wholly devoted\\n      himself as to neglect the rest. They complained to their father, and\\n      Daksha repeatedly interposed, till, finding his remonstrances vain,\\n      he denounced a curse upon his son-in-law, in consequence of which he\\n      remained childless and became affected by consumption. The wives of\\n      Chandra having interceded in his behalf with their father, Daksha\\n      modified an imprecation which he could not recall, and pronounced\\n      that the decay should be periodical only, not permanent, and that it\\n      should alternate with periods of recovery. Hence the successive wane\\n      and increase of the Moon. _Padma_, _PurÃ¡á¹\\x87a_, _Swarga-Khaá¹\\x87á¸\\x8da,_ Sec.\\n      II. _Rohiá¹\\x87Ã\\xad_ in Astronomy is the fourth lunar mansion, containing\\n      five stars, the principal of which is Aldebaran.â\\x80\\x9d WILSON, _Specimens\\n      of the Hindu Theatre.

Meru and KailÃ¡sa are the two Indian Olympi. Perhaps they were\\n      held in such veneration because the Sanskrit-speaking Indians\\n      remembered the ancient home where they dwelt with the other\\n      primitive peoples of their family before they descended to occupy\\n      the vast plains which extend between the Indus and the Ganges.â\\x80\\x9d\\n      GORRESIO.\\n\\n   28 The third God of the Indian Triad, the God of destruction and\\n      reproduction.

The\\n      Krita, called also the Deva-yuga or that of the Gods, is the age of\\n      truth, the perfect age, the TretÃ¡ is the age of the three sacred\\n      fires, domestic and sacrificial; the DwÃ¡para is the age of doubt;\\n      the Kali, the present age, is the age of evil.â\\x80\\x9d GORRESIO.\\n\\n   41 The ancient kings of India enjoyed lives of more than patriarchal\\n      length as will appear in the course of the poem.\\n\\n   42 Å\\x9aÃºdras, men of the fourth and lowest pure caste, were not allowed to\\n      read the poem, but might hear it recited.\\n\\n   43 The three _Å\\x9blokes_ or distichs which these twelve lines represent\\n      are evidently a still later and very awkward addition to the\\n      introduction.\\n\\n   44 There are several rivers in India of this name, now corrupted into\\n      _Tonse_.

Thence the later author of these\\n      introductory cantos has borrowed the name and person, inconsistently\\n      indeed, but with the intention of enhancing the dignity of the poet\\n      by ascribing to him so celebrated a disciple.â\\x80\\x9d SCHLEGEL.\\n\\n   46 The poet plays upon the similarity in sound of the two words:\\n      _Å\\x9boka_, means grief, _Å\\x9bloka_, the heroic measure in which the poem\\n      is composed. It need scarcely be said that the derivation is\\n      fanciful.\\n\\n   47 BrahmÃ¡, the Creator, is usually regarded as the first person of the\\n      divine triad of India. The four heads with which he is represented\\n      are supposed to have allusion to the four corners of the earth which\\n      he is sometimes considered to personify. As an object of adoration\\n      BrahmÃ¡ has been entirely superseded by Å\\x9aiva and Vishá¹\\x87u. In the whole\\n      of India there is, I believe, but one temple dedicated to his\\n      worship. In this point the first of the Indian triad curiously\\n      resembles the last of the divine fraternity of Greece, AÃ¯des the\\n      brother of Zeus and Poseidon. â\\x80\\x9cIn all Greece, says Pausanias, there\\n      is no single temple of AÃ¯des, except at a single spot in Elis.â\\x80\\x9d See\\n      Gladstoneâ\\x80\\x99s Juventus Mundi, p. 253.\\n\\n   48 The _argha_ or _arghya_ was a libation or offering to a deity, a\\n      BrÃ¡hman, or other venerable personage.

In Zend it appears as\\n      _Hendu_ in a somewhat wider sense. With the Persians later the\\n      signification of _Hind_ seems to have co-extended with their\\n      increasing acquaintance with the country.

To this the poet has already alluded in\\n      Canto xxiii. These incorporeal weapons are partly represented\\n      according to the fashion of those ascribed to the Gods and the\\n      different orders of demi-gods, partly are the mere creations of\\n      fancy; and it would not be easy to say what idea the poet had of\\n      them in his own mind, or what powers he meant to assign to each.â\\x80\\x9d\\n      SCHLEGEL.\\n\\n  166 â\\x80\\x9cIn Sanskrit _SankÃ¡ra_, a word which has various significations but\\n      the primary meaning of which is _the act of seizing_.

MÃºlam\\n      utsá¹\\x9bijya kasmÃ¡t tvam sÃ¡khÃ¡sv ichhasi lambitum. â\\x80\\x98Why, forsaking the\\n      root, dost thou desire to hang upon the branches?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d MUIR, Sanskrit\\n      Texts, Vol. I., p. 401.\\n\\n  236 A Chaá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dÃ¡la was a man born of the illegal and impure union of a Å\\x9aÃºdra\\n      with a woman of one of the three higher castes.\\n\\n  237 â\\x80\\x9cThe Chaá¹\\x87á¸\\x8dÃ¡la was regarded as the vilest and most abject of the men\\n      sprung from wedlock forbidden by the law (MÃ¡navadharmaÅ\\x9bÃ¡stra, Lib.\\n      X. 12.); a kind of social malediction weighed upon his head and\\n      rejected him from human society.â\\x80\\x9d GORRESIO.\\n\\n  238 This appellation, occuring nowhere else in the poem except as the\\n      name of a city, appears twice in this Canto as a name of VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha.\\n\\n  239 â\\x80\\x9cThe seven ancient rishis or saints, as has been said before, were\\n      the seven stars of Ursa Major. The seven other new saints which are\\n      here said to have been created by ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra should be seven new\\n      southern stars, a sort of new Ursa. Von Schlegel thinks that this\\n      mythical fiction of new stars created by ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra may signify that\\n      these southern stars, unknown to the Indians as long as they\\n      remained in the neighbourhood of the Ganges, became known to them at\\n      a later date when they colonized the southern regions of India.â\\x80\\x9d\\n      GORRESIO.\\n\\n  240 â\\x80\\x9cThis cannot refer to the events just related: for ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra was\\n      successful in the sacrifice performed for TriÅ\\x9banku. And yet no other\\n      impediment is mentioned. Still his restless mind would not allow him\\n      to remain longer in the same spot. So the character of ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra is\\n      ingeniously and skilfully shadowed forth: as he had been formerly a\\n      most warlike king, loving battle and glory, bold, active, sometimes\\n      unjust, and more frequently magnanimous, such also he always shows\\n      himself in his character of anchorite and ascetic.â\\x80\\x9d SCHLEGEL.\\n\\n  241 Near the modern city of Ajmere. The place is sacred still, and the\\n      name is preserved in the HindÃ\\xad. Lassen, however, says that this\\n      Pushkala or Pushkara, called by the Grecian writers Î\\xa0ÎµÏ\\x85ÎºÎµÎ»á½·Ï\\x84Î¹Ï\\x82, the\\n      earliest place of pilgrimage mentioned by name, is not to be\\n      confounded with the modern Pushkara in Ajmere.\\n\\n  242 â\\x80\\x9cAmbarÃ\\xadsha is the twenty-ninth in descent from IkshvÃ¡ku, and is\\n      therefore separated by an immense space of time from TriÅ\\x9banku in\\n      whose story ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra had played so important a part. Yet RichÃ\\xadka,\\n      who is represented as having young sons while AmbarÃ\\xadsha was yet\\n      reigning being himself the son of Bhrigu and to be numbered with the\\n      most ancient sages, is said to have married the younger sister of\\n      ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra. But I need not again remark that there is a perpetual\\n      anachronism in Indian mythology.â\\x80\\x9d SCHLEGEL..\\n\\n      â\\x80\\x9cIn the mythical story related in this and the following Canto we\\n      may discover, I think, some indication of the epoch at which the\\n      immolation of lower animals was substituted for human sacrifice.â\\x80¦ So\\n      when Iphigenia was about to be sacrificed at Aulis, one legend tells\\n      us that a hind was substituted for the virgin.â\\x80\\x9d GORRESIO.\\n\\n      So the ram caught in the thicket took the place of Isaac, or, as the\\n      MusalmÃ¡ns say, of Ishmael.\\n\\n  243 The Indian Cupid.\\n\\n  244 â\\x80\\x9cThe same as she whose praises ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra has already sung in Canto\\n      XXXV, and whom the poet brings yet alive upon the scene in Canto\\n      LXI. Her proper name was _SatyavatÃ\\xad_ (Truthful); the patronymic,\\n      KauÅ\\x9bikÃ\\xad was preserved by the river into which she is said to have\\n      been changed, and is still recognized in the corrupted forms KuÅ\\x9ba\\n      and KuÅ\\x9bÃ\\xad. The river flows from the heights of the HimÃ¡laya towards\\n      the Ganges, bounding on the east the country of Videha (Behar). The\\n      name is no doubt half hidden in the _Cosoagus_ of Pliny and the\\n      _Kossounos_ of Arrian. But each author has fallen into the same\\n      error in his enumeration of these rivers (Condochatem, Erannoboam,\\n      Cosoagum, Sonum). The Erannoboas, (Hiraá¹\\x87yavÃ¡ha) and the Sone are not\\n      different streams, but well-known names of the same river. Moreover\\n      the order is disturbed, in which on the right and left they fall\\n      into the Ganges. To be consistent with geography it should be\\n      written: Erannoboam sive Sonum, Condochatem (GandakÃ\\xad), Cosoagum.â\\x80\\x9d\\n      SCHLEGEL.\\n\\n  245 â\\x80\\x9cDaksha was one of the ancient Progenitors or PrajÃ¡patis created by\\n      BrahmÃ¡. The sacrifice which is here spoken of and in which Å\\x9aankar or\\n      Å\\x9aiva (called also here Rudra and Bhava) smote the Gods because he\\n      had not been invited to share the sacred oblations with them, seems\\n      to refer to the origin of the worship of Å\\x9aiva, to its increase and\\n      to the struggle it maintained with other older forms of worship.â\\x80\\x9d\\n      GORRESIO.\\n\\n  246 SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ means a furrow.\\n\\n            â\\x80\\x9cGreat Erectheus swayed,\\n      That owed his nurture to the blue-eyed maid,\\n      But from the teeming furrow took his birth,\\n      The mighty offspring of the foodful earth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n      Iliad, Book II.\\n\\n  247 â\\x80\\x9cThe whole story of SÃ\\xadtÃ¡, as will be seen in the course of the poem\\n      has a great analogy with the ancient myth of Proserpine.â\\x80\\x9d GORRESIO.\\n\\n  248 A different lady from the Goddess of the Jumna who bears the same\\n      name.\\n\\n  249 This is another fanciful derivation, _Sa_â\\x80\\x94with, and _gara_â\\x80\\x94poison.\\n\\n_  250 PurushÃ¡dak_ means a cannibal.

None of our surveyors or geographers have been\\n      oriental scholars. It may be doubted if any of them have been\\n      conversant with the spoken language of the country. They have,\\n      consequently, put down names at random, according to their own\\n      inaccurate appreciation of sounds carelessly, vulgarly, and\\n      corruptly uttered; and their maps of India are crowded with\\n      appellations which bear no similitude whatever either to past or\\n      present denominations. We need not wonder that we cannot discover\\n      Sanskrit names in English maps, when, in the immediate vicinity of\\n      Calcutta, Barnagore represents BarÃ¡hanagar, DakshineÅ\\x9bwar is\\n      metamorphosed into Duckinsore, UlubarÃ\\xada into Willoughbury.â\\x80¦ There is\\n      scarcely a name in our Indian maps that does not afford proof of\\n      extreme indifference to accuracy in nomenclature, and of an\\n      incorrectness in estimating sounds, which is, in some degree,\\n      perhaps, a national defect.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n      For further information regarding the road from AyodhyÃ¡ to\\n      RÃ¡jagriha, see _Additional Notes_.\\n\\n  348 â\\x80\\x9cThe Å\\x9aatadrÃº, â\\x80\\x98the hundred-channeledâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94the Zaradrus of Ptolemy,\\n      Hesydrus of Plinyâ\\x80\\x94is the Sutlej.â\\x80\\x9d WILSONâ\\x80\\x99S _Vishá¹\\x87u PurÃ¡á¹\\x87a_, Vol. II.\\n      p. 130.\\n\\n  349 The SarasvatÃ\\xad or Sursooty is a tributary of the Caggar or Guggur in\\n      Sirhind.\\n\\n_  350 SÃºryamcha pratimehatu_, adversus solem mingat.

To a European taste it\\n      is the most intolerably tedious of the whole poem, abounding in\\n      repetition, overloaded description, and long and useless speeches\\n      which impede the action of the poem. Manifest interpolations of\\n      whole Cantos also occur.

Does the epithet, Descendant of Daksha, given to\\n      SurasÃ¡, mean that she is one of those daughters? I think not.

RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s own dwelling seems to have been\\n      situated within the enchanted chariot Pushpak: but the description\\n      is involved and confused, and it is difficult to say whether the\\n      chariot was inside the palace or the palace inside the chariot.\\n\\n  811 Pushpak from _pushpa_ a flower.

This charity\\n      is to embrace not human beings only, but bird and beast as well: â\\x80\\x9cHe\\n      prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  833 It was the custom of Indian warriors to mark their arrows with their\\n      ciphers or names, and it seems to have been regarded as a point of\\n      honour to give an enemy the satisfaction of knowing who had shot at\\n      him. This passage however contains, if my memory serves me well, the\\n      first mention in the poem of this practice, and as arrows have been\\n      so frequently mentioned and described with almost every conceivable\\n      epithet, its occurrence here seems suspicious. No mention of, or\\n      allusion to writing has hitherto occurred in the poem.\\n\\n  834 This threat in the same words occurs in Book III, Canto LVI.\\n\\n  835 RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 carried off and kept in his palace not only earthly princesses\\n      but the daughters of Gods and Gandharvas.\\n\\n  836 The wife of Indra.\\n\\n  837 These four lines have occurred before. Book III, Canto LVI.\\n\\n  838 PrajÃ¡patis are the ten lords of created beings first created by\\n      BrahmÃ¡; somewhat like the Demiurgi of the Gnostics.\\n\\n  839 â\\x80\\x9cThis is the number of the Vedic divinities mentioned in the\\n      Rig-veda. In Ashá¹\\xadaka I. SÃºkta XXXIV, the Rishi Hiraá¹\\x87yastÃºpa invoking\\n      the AÅ\\x9bvins says: Ã\\x81 NÃ¡satyÃ¡ tribhirekÃ¡daÅ\\x9bairiha devebniryÃ¡tam: â\\x80\\x98O\\n      NÃ¡satyas (AÅ\\x9bvins) come hither with the thrice eleven Gods.â\\x80\\x99 And in\\n      SÃºkta XLV, the Rishi Praskanva addressing his hymn to Agni (ignis,\\n      fire), thus invokes him: â\\x80\\x98Lord of the red steeds, propitiated by our\\n      prayers lead hither the thirty-three Gods.â\\x80\\x99 This number must\\n      certainly have been the actual number in the early days of the Vedic\\n      religion: although it appears probable enough that the thirty-three\\n      Vedic divinities could not then be found co-ordinated in so\\n      systematic a way as they were arranged more recently by the authors\\n      of the Upanishads. In the later ages of Bramanism the number went on\\n      increasing without measure by successive mythical and religious\\n      creations which peopled the Indian Olympus with abstract beings of\\n      every kind. But through lasting veneration of the word of the Veda\\n      the custom regained of giving the name of â\\x80\\x98the thirty-three Godsâ\\x80\\x99 to\\n      the immense phalanx of the multiplied deities.â\\x80\\x9d GORRESIO.\\n\\n  840 Serpent-Gods who dwell in the regions under the earth.\\n\\n  841 In the mythology of the epics the Gandharvas are the heavenly\\n      singers or musicians who form the orchestra at the banquets of the\\n      Gods, and they belong to the heaven of India in whose battles they\\n      share.\\n\\n  842 The mother of RÃ¡ma.\\n\\n  843 The mother of Lakshmaá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  844 In the south is the region of YÃ¡ma the God of Death, the place of\\n      departed spirits.\\n\\n  845 Kumbhakará¹\\x87a was one of RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s brothers.\\n\\n  846 The guards are still in the grove, but they are asleep; and SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ has\\n      crept to a tree at some distance from them.\\n\\n  847 â\\x80\\x9cAs the reason assigned in these passages for not addressing SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ in\\n      Sanskrit such as a BrÃ¡hman would use is not that she would not\\n      understand it, but that it would alarm her and be unsuitable to the\\n      speaker, we must take them as indicating that Sanskrit, if not\\n      spoken by women of the upper classes at the time when the RÃ¡mÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a\\n      was written (whenever that may have been), was at least understood\\n      by them, and was commonly spoken by men of the priestly class, and\\n      other educated persons. By the Sanskrit proper to an [ordinary] man,\\n      alluded to in the second passage, may perhaps be understood not a\\n      language in which words different from Sanskrit were used, but the\\n      employment of formal and elaborate diction.â\\x80\\x9d MUIRâ\\x80\\x99S _Sanskrit\\n      Texts_, Part II. p. 166.\\n\\n  848 Svayambhu, the Self-existent, BrahmÃ¡.\\n\\n  849 Vá¹\\x9bihaspati or VÃ¡chaspati, the Lord of Speech and preceptor of the\\n      Gods.\\n\\n  850 The Asurs were the fierce enemies of the Gods.\\n\\n  851 The Rudras are manifestations of Å\\x9aiva.\\n\\n  852 The Maruts or Storm Gods.\\n\\n  853 Rohiá¹\\x87Ã\\xad is an asterism personified as the daughter of Daksha and the\\n      favourite wife of the Moon. The chief star in the constellation is\\n      Aldebaran.\\n\\n  854 ArundhatÃ\\xad was the wife of the great sage VaÅ\\x9bishá¹\\xadha, and regarded as\\n      the pattern of conjugal excellence. She was raised to the heavens as\\n      one of the Pleiades.\\n\\n  855 The Gods do not shed tears; nor do they touch the ground when they\\n      walk or stand. Similarly Miltonâ\\x80\\x99s angels marched above the ground\\n      and â\\x80\\x9cthe passive air upbore their nimble tread.â\\x80\\x9d Virgilâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cvera\\n      incessu patuit deaâ\\x80\\x9d may refer to the same belief.\\n\\n  856 That a friend of RÃ¡ma would praise him as he should be praised, and\\n      that if the stranger were RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 in disguise he would avoid the\\n      subject.\\n\\n  857 Kuvera the God of Gold.\\n\\n  858 SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ of course knows nothing of what has happened to RÃ¡ma since the\\n      time when she was carried away by RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87. The poet therefore thinks\\n      it necessary to repeat the whole story of the meeting between RÃ¡ma\\n      and SugrÃ\\xadva, the defeat of BÃ¡lÃ\\xad, and subsequent events. I give the\\n      briefest possible outline of the story.\\n\\n  859 DE GUBERNATIS thinks that this ring which the Sun RÃ¡ma sends to the\\n      Dawn SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ is a symbol of the sunâ\\x80\\x99s disc.\\n\\n  860 Å\\x9aachÃ\\xad is the loved and lovely wife of Indra, and she is taken as the\\n      type of a woman protected by a jealous and all-powerful husband.\\n\\n  861 The mountain near KishkindhÃ¡.\\n\\n  862 AirÃ¡vat is the mighty elephant on which Indra delights to ride.\\n\\n  863 Vibhishaá¹\\x87 is the wicked RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s good brother.\\n\\n  864 Her name is KalÃ¡, or in the Bengal recension NandÃ¡.\\n\\n  865 One of RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s chief councillors.\\n\\n  866 HanumÃ¡n when he entered the city had in order to escape observation\\n      condensed himself to the size of a cat.\\n\\n  867 The brook MandÃ¡kinÃ\\xad, not far from ChitrakÃºá¹\\xada where RÃ¡ma sojourned\\n      for a time.\\n\\n  868 The poet here changes from the second person to the third.\\n\\n  869 The whole long story is repeated with some slight variations and\\n      additions from Book II, Canto XCVI. I give here only the outline.\\n\\n  870 The expedients to vanquish an enemy or to make him come to terms are\\n      said to be four: conciliation, gifts, disunion, and force or\\n      punishment. HanumÃ¡n considers it useless to employ the first three\\n      and resolves to punish RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 by destroying his pleasure-grounds.\\n\\n  871 Kinkar means the special servant of a sovereign, who receives his\\n      orders immediately from his master. The Bengal recension gives these\\n      RÃ¡kshases an epithet which the Commentator explains â\\x80\\x9cas generated in\\n      the mind of BrahmÃ¡.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  872 RÃ¡ma _de jure_ King of KoÅ\\x9bal of which AyodhyÃ¡ was the capital.\\n\\n_  873 ChaityaprÃ¡sÃ¡da_ is explained by the Commentator as the place where\\n      the Gods of the RÃ¡kshases were kept.

Gorresio remarks:\\n      â\\x80\\x9cThis comparison of a great lake to the sky and of celestial to\\n      aquatic objects is one of those ideas which the view and qualities\\n      of natural scenery awake in lively fancies. Imagine one of those\\n      grand and splendid lakes of India covered with lotus blossoms,\\n      furrowed by wild-ducks of the most vivid colours, mantled over here\\n      and there with flowers and water weeds &c. and it will be understood\\n      how the fancy of the poet could readily compare to the sky radiant\\n      with celestial azure the blue expanse of the water, to the soft\\n      light of the moon the inner hue of the lotus, to the splendour of\\n      the sun the brilliant colours of the wild-fowl, to the stars the\\n      flowers, to the cloud the weeds that float upon the water &c.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  889 SunÃ¡bha is the mountain that rose from the sea when HanumÃ¡n passed\\n      over to LankÃ¡.\\n\\n  890 Three Cantos of repetition are omitted.\\n\\n_  891 Madhuvan_ the â\\x80\\x9choney-wood.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  892 Indraâ\\x80\\x99s pleasure-ground or elysium.\\n\\n  893 Janak was king of Videha or MithilÃ¡ in Behar.\\n\\n  894 The original contains two more Cantos which end the Book.

In the Bengal recension the\\n      preceding speakers and speeches differ considerably from those given\\n      in the text which I follow. Vibhishaá¹\\x87 is kicked from his seat by\\n      RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87, and then, after telling his mother what has happened, he\\n      flies to Mount KailÃ¡sa where he has an interview with Å\\x9aiva, and by\\n      his advice seeks RÃ¡ma and the VÃ¡nar army.\\n\\n  928 Vá¹\\x9bihaspati the preceptor of the Gods.\\n\\n  929 In Book II, Canto XXI, Kaá¹\\x87du is mentioned by RÃ¡ma as an example of\\n      filial obedience.

It soon reaches a hundred thousand billions.\\n\\n  943 I omit the rest of this canto, which is mere repetition. RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 gives\\n      in the same words his former answer that the Gods, Gandharvas and\\n      fiends combined shall not force him to give up SÃ\\xadtÃ¡. He then orders\\n      Å\\x9aÃ¡rdÃºla to tell him the names of the VÃ¡nar chieftains whom he has\\n      seen in RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s army. These have already been mentioned by Å\\x9auka and\\n      SÃ¡raá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  944 LakshmÃ\\xad is the Goddess both of beauty and fortune, and is\\n      represented with a lotus in her hand.\\n\\n  945 The poet appears to have forgotten that Å\\x9auka and SÃ¡raá¹\\x87 were\\n      dismissed with ignominy in Canto XXIX, and have not been reinstated.\\n\\n  946 The four who fled with him. Their names are Anala, Panasa, SampÃ¡ti,\\n      and Pramati.\\n\\n  947 The numbers here are comparatively moderate: ten thousand elephants,\\n      ten thousand chariots, twenty thousand horses and ten million\\n      giants.\\n\\n  948 The KinÅ\\x9buk, also called PalÃ¡Å\\x9ba, is Butea Frondosa, a tree that bears\\n      beautiful red crescent shaped blossoms and is deservedly a favorite\\n      with poets. The Seemal or Å\\x9aÃ¡lmalÃ\\xad is the silk cotton tree which also\\n      bears red blossoms.\\n\\n  949 Varuá¹\\x87a.\\n\\n  950 The duty of a king to save the lives of his people and avoid\\n      bloodshed until milder methods have been tried in vain.\\n\\n  951 I have omitted several of these single combats, as there is little\\n      variety in the details and each duel results in the victory of the\\n      VÃ¡nar or his ally.\\n\\n  952 YajnaÅ\\x9batru, MahÃ¡pÃ¡rÅ\\x9bva, Mahodar, Vajradanshá¹\\xadra, Å\\x9auka, and SÃ¡raá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  953 Angad.\\n\\n  954 A mysterious weapon consisting of serpents transformed to arrows\\n      which deprived the wounded object of all sense and power of motion.\\n\\n  955 On each foot, and at the root of each finger.\\n\\n  956 Varuá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  957 The name of one of the mystical weapons the command over which was\\n      given by ViÅ\\x9bvÃ¡mitra to RÃ¡ma, as related in Book I.\\n\\n  958 One of SÃ\\xadtÃ¡â\\x80\\x99s guard, and her comforter on a former occasion also.\\n\\n  959 The preceptor of the Gods.\\n\\n  960 RÃ¡maâ\\x80\\x99s grandfather.\\n\\n  961 The Gandharvas are warriors and Minstrels of Indraâ\\x80\\x99s heaven.\\n\\n  962 â\\x80\\x9cIt is to be understood,â\\x80\\x9d says the commentator, â\\x80\\x9cthat this is not\\n      the Akampan who has already been slain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  963 RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s son, whom HanumÃ¡n killed when he first visited LankÃ¡.\\n\\n  964 NÃ\\xadla was the son of Agni the God of Fire, and possessed, like\\n      Miltonâ\\x80\\x99s demons, the power of dilating and condensing his form at\\n      pleasure.\\n\\n  965 An ancient king of AyodhyÃ¡ said by some to have been Prithuâ\\x80\\x99s\\n      father.\\n\\n  966 The daughter of King KuÅ\\x9badhwaja. She became an ascetic, and being\\n      insulted by RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 in the woods where she was performing penance,\\n      destroyed herself by entering fire, but was born again as SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ to be\\n      in turn the destruction of him who had insulted her.\\n\\n  967 NandÃ\\xadÅ\\x9bvara was Å\\x9aivaâ\\x80\\x99s chief attendant. RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 had despised and\\n      laughed at him for appearing in the form of a monkey and the\\n      irritated NandÃ\\xadÅ\\x9bvara cursed him and foretold his destruction by\\n      monkeys.\\n\\n  968 RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 once upheaved and shook Mount KailÃ¡sa the favourite dwelling\\n      place of Å\\x9aiva the consort of UmÃ¡, and was cursed in consequence by\\n      the offended Goddess.\\n\\n  969 RambhÃ¡, who has several times been mentioned in the course of the\\n      poem, was one of the nymphs of heaven, and had been insulted by\\n      RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  970 PunjikasthalÃ¡ was the daughter of Varuá¹\\x87. RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 himself has mentioned\\n      in this book his insult to her, and the curse pronounced in\\n      consequence by BrahmÃ¡.\\n\\n  971 Pulastya was the son of BrahmÃ¡ and father of ViÅ\\x9bravas or Paulastya\\n      the father of RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87 and Kumbhakará¹\\x87a.\\n\\n  972 I omit a tedious sermon on the danger of rashness and the advantages\\n      of prudence, sufficient to irritate a less passionate hearer than\\n      RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  973 The Bengal recension assigns a very different speech to Kumbhakará¹\\x87a\\n      and makes him say that NÃ¡rad the messenger of the Gods had formerly\\n      told him that Vishá¹\\x87u himself incarnate as DaÅ\\x9barathaâ\\x80\\x99s son should\\n      come to destroy RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  974 Mahodar, Dwijihva, SanhrÃ¡da, and Vitardan.\\n\\n  975 A name of Vishá¹\\x87u.\\n\\n  976 There is so much commonplace repetition in these Sallies of the\\n      RÃ¡kshas chieftains that omissions are frequently necessary. The\\n      usual ill omens attend the sally of Kumbhakará¹\\x87a, and the Canto ends\\n      with a description of the terrified VÃ¡narsâ\\x80\\x99 flight which is briefly\\n      repeated in different words at the beginning of the next Canto.\\n\\n  977 KÃ¡rtikeya the God of War, and the hero and incarnation ParaÅ\\x9burÃ¡ma\\n      are said to have cut a passage through the mountain Krauncha, a part\\n      of the HimÃ¡layan range, in the same way as the immense gorge that\\n      splits the Pyrenees under the towers of MarborÃ© was cloven at one\\n      blow of Rolandâ\\x80\\x99s sword Durandal.\\n\\n  978 Rishabh, Å\\x9aarabh, NÃ\\xadla, GavÃ¡ksha, and GandhamÃ¡dan.\\n\\n  979 Angad. The text calls him the son of the son of him who holds the\\n      thunderbolt, _i.e._ the grandson of Indra.\\n\\n  980 Literally, weighing a thousand _bhÃ¡ras_. The _bhÃ¡ra_ is a weight\\n      equal to 2000 _palas_, the _pala_ is equal to four _karÅ\\x9bas_, and the\\n      _karÅ\\x9ba_ to 11375 French grammes or about 176 grains troy. The spear\\n      seems very light for a warrior of Kumbhakará¹\\x87aâ\\x80\\x99s strength and stature\\n      and the work performed with it.\\n\\n  981 The custom of throwing parched or roasted grain, with wreaths and\\n      flowers, on the heads of kings and conquerors when they go forth to\\n      battle and return is frequently mentioned by Indian poets.\\n\\n  982 Lakshmaá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  983 I have abridged this long Canto by omitting some vain repetitions,\\n      commonplace epithets and similes and other unimportant matter. There\\n      are many verses in this Canto which European scholars would rigidly\\n      exclude as unmistakeably the work of later rhapsodists. Even the\\n      reverent Commentator whom I follow ventures to remark once or twice:\\n      _Ayam Å\\x9bloka prak shipta iti bahavah_, â\\x80\\x9cThis _Å\\x9bloka_ or verse is in\\n      the opinion of many interpolated.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  984 Narak was a demon, son of BhÃºmi or Earth, who haunted the city\\n      PrÃ¡gjyotisha.\\n\\n  985 Å\\x9aambar was a demon of drought.\\n\\n  986 Indra.\\n\\n  987 DevÃ¡ntak (Slayer of Gods) NarÃ¡ntak (Slayer of Men) AtikÃ¡ya (Huge of\\n      Frame) and TriÅ\\x9birÃ¡s (Three Headed) were all sons of RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  988 The demon of eclipse who seizes the Sun and Moon.\\n\\n  989 Lakshmaá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  990 In such cases as this I am not careful to reproduce the numbers of\\n      the poet, which in the text which I follow are 670000000; the Bengal\\n      recension being content with thirty million less.\\n\\n  991 The discus or quoit, a sharp-edged circular missile is the favourite\\n      weapon of Vishá¹\\x87u.\\n\\n  992 To destroy Tripura the triple city in the sky, air and earth, built\\n      by Maya for a celebrated Asur or demon, or as another commentator\\n      explains, to destroy Kandarpa or Love.\\n\\n  993 The LokapÃ¡las are sometimes regarded as deities appointed by BrahmÃ¡\\n      at the creation of the word to act as guardians of different orders\\n      of beings, but more commonly they are identified with the deities\\n      presiding over the four cardinal and four intermediate points of the\\n      compass, which, according to Manu V. 96, are 1, Indra, guardian of\\n      the East; 2, Agni, of the South-east; 3, YÃ¡ma, of the South; 4,\\n      SÃºrya, of the South-west; 5, Varuá¹\\x87a, of the West; 6, Pavana or VÃ¡yu,\\n      of the North-west; 7, Kuvera, of the North; 8, Soma or Chandra, of\\n      the North-east.\\n\\n  994 The chariots of RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87â\\x80\\x99s present army are said to have been one\\n      hundred and fifty million in number with three hundred million\\n      elephants, and twelve hundred million horses and asses. The footmen\\n      are merely said to have been â\\x80\\x9cunnumbered.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n  995 It is not very easy to see the advantage of having arrows headed in\\n      the way mentioned. Fanciful names for war-engines and weapons\\n      derived from their resemblance to various animals are not confined\\n      to India. The â\\x80\\x9cWar-wolfâ\\x80\\x9d was used by Edward I. at the siege of\\n      Brechin, the â\\x80\\x9cCat-houseâ\\x80\\x9d and the â\\x80\\x9cSowâ\\x80\\x9d were used by Edward III. at\\n      the siege of Dunbar.\\n\\n  996 Apparently a peak of the Himalaya chain.\\n\\n  997 This exploit of HanumÃ¡n is related with inordinate prolixity in the\\n      Bengal recension (Gortesioâ\\x80\\x99s text). Among other adventures he\\n      narrowly escapes being shot by Bharat as he passes over Nandigrama\\n      near AyodhyÃ¡. HanumÃ¡n stays Bharat in time, and gives him an account\\n      of what has befallen RÃ¡ma and SÃ\\xadtÃ¡ in the forest and in LankÃ¡.\\n\\n  998 As Garuá¸\\x8d the king of birds is the mortal enemy of serpents the\\n      weapon sacred to him is of course best calculated to destroy the\\n      serpent arrows of RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87.\\n\\n  999 The celebrated saint who has on former occasions assisted RÃ¡ma with\\n      his gifts and counsel.\\n\\n 1000 Indra.\\n\\n 1001 YÃ¡ma.\\n\\n 1002 KÃ¡rtikeya.\\n\\n 1003 Kubera.\\n\\n 1004 Varuá¹\\x87.\\n\\n 1005 The Pitris, forefathers or spirits of the dead, are of two kinds,\\n      either the spirits of the father, grandfathers and\\n      great-grandfathers of an individual or the progenitors of mankind\\n      generally, to both of whom obsequial worship is paid and oblations\\n      of food are presented.\\n\\n 1006 The Maruts or Storm-Gods.\\n\\n 1007 The Heavenly Twins, the Castor and Pollux of the Hindus.\\n\\n 1008 The Man _par excellence_, the representative man and father of the\\n      human race regarded also as God.\\n\\n 1009 The Vasus, a class of deities originally personifications of natural\\n      phenomena.\\n\\n 1010 A class of celestial beings who dwell between the earth and the sun.\\n\\n 1011 The seven horses are supposed to symbolize the seven days of the\\n      week.\\n\\n 1012 One for each month in the year.\\n\\n 1013 The garden of Kuvera, the God of Riches.\\n\\n 1014 The consort of Indra.\\n\\n 1015 The Swayamvara, Self-choice or election of a husband by a princess\\n      or daughter of a Kshatriya at a public assembly of suitors held for\\n      the purpose.

He who listens to\\n      this wondrous tale of RÃ¡ma unwearied in action shall be absolved\\n      from all his sins. By listening to the deeds of RÃ¡ma he who wishes\\n      for sons shall obtain his heartâ\\x80\\x99s desire, and to him who longs for\\n      riches shall riches be given. The virgin who asks for a husband\\n      shall obtain a husband suited to her mind, and shall meet again her\\n      dear kinsfolk who are far away. They who hear this poem which\\n      VÃ¡lmÃ\\xadki made shall obtain all their desires and all their prayers\\n      shall be fulfilled.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n_ 1030 The Academy_, Vol. III., No 43, contains an able and interesting\\n      notice of this work from the pen of the Professor of Sanskrit in the\\n      University of Cambridge: â\\x80\\x9cThe _UttarakÃ¡á¹\\x87á¸\\x8da_,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Cowell remarks,\\n      â\\x80\\x9cbears the same relation to the _RÃ¡mÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a_ as the Cyclic poems to\\n      the _Iliad_. Just as the _Cypria_ of Stasinus, the _Ã\\x86thiopis_ of\\n      Arctinus, and the little _Iliad_ of Lesches completed the story of\\n      the _Iliad_, and not only added the series of events which preceded\\n      and followed it, but also founded episodes of their own on isolated\\n      allusions in Homer, so the _UttarakÃ¡á¹\\x87á¸\\x8da_ is intended to complete the\\n      _RÃ¡mÃ¡yaá¹\\x87a_, and at the same time to supplement it by intervening\\n      episodes to explain casual allusions or isolated incidents which\\n      occur in it. Thus the early history of the giant RÃ¡vaá¹\\x87a and his\\n      family fills nearly forty Chapters, and we have a full account of\\n      his wars with the gods and his conquest of LankÃ¡, which all happened\\n      long before the action of the poem commences, just as the _Cypria_\\n      narrated the birth and early history of Helen, and the two\\n      expeditions of the Greeks against Troy; and the latter chapters\\n      continue the history of the hero RÃ¡ma after his triumphant return to\\n      his paternal kingdom, and the poem closes with his death and that of\\n      his brothers, and the founding by their descendants of various\\n      kingdoms in different parts of India.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n 1031 MUIR, _Sanskrit Texts,_ Part IV., pp. 414 ff.\\n\\n 1032 MUIR, _Sanskrit Texts_, Part IV., 391, 392.\\n\\n 1033 See _Academy_, III., 43.\\n\\n_ 1034 Academy_, Vol. III., No. 43.\\n\\n 1035 E.

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\\nrequirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\\nwith offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\\nand addresses.

For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢\\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenbergâ\\x84¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\\nwith any particular paper edition.\\n\\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBookâ\\x80\\x99s eBook\\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\\n(zipped), HTML and others.\\n\\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n\\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢, including how\\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n***FINIS***\\n'"

    "Now, you need to **tokenize** the text of a book. To do so, create a function `tokenize` that takes in a string, `book_string`, and returns a **list of the tokens** (words, numbers, and all punctuation) satisfying the following conditions:\n",
    "* The start of every paragraph should be represented in the list with the single character `'\\x02'` (standing for START).\n",
    "* The end of every paragraph should be represented in the list with the single character `'\\x03'` (standing for STOP).\n",
    "* Tokens should include *no* whitespace.\n",
    "* Two or more newlines count as a paragraph break. Whitespace (e.g. multiple newlines) between two paragraphs of text should not appear as tokens.\n",
    "* All punctuation marks count as tokens, even if they are uncommon (e.g. `'@'`, `'+'`, and `'%'` are all valid tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following excerpt. (The first sentence is at the end of a larger paragraph, and the second sentence is at the start of a longer paragraph.)\n",
    "```\n",

    "My phone's dead.\n",

    "***Note:*** `tokenize` should run quickly; you should avoid loops when possible (our solution only has one loop). Specifically, `tokenize` should run on the the complete works of Shakespeare (in `data/shakespeare.txt`) in **under 10 seconds** to get full credit."

    "## Part 2: Creating Baseline Language Models 📕\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're able to tokenize a corpus, it is time to start building language models (LM).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build three different language models. They all operate under the premise of assigning probabilities to sentences. Given a sentence – that is, a sequence of tokens $w = w_1\\ldots w_n$ – we want to be able to compute the **probability** that sentence is used: \n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sentences are built from tokens, and the likelihood that a token occurs where it does depends on the tokens before it. This points to using **conditional probability** to compute $P(w)$. That is, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "This is also called the **chain rule** for probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider the sentence \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><code>'when I drink Coke I smile'</code></center>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The probability that it occurs, according the the chain rule, is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink | when I})\\cdot P(\\text{Coke | when I drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when I drink Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile | when I drink Coke I})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the probability that the sentence occurs is the product of the probability that each subsequent token follows the tokens that came before. For example, the probability $P(\\text{Coke | when I drink})$ is likely pretty high, as Coke is something that you drink. The probability $P(\\text{pizza | when I drink})$ is likely low (if not 0), because pizza is not something that you drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder how the language model \"knows\" that Coke is something that you drink, but pizza is not. The way that the language model \"learns\" its probabilities is by **looking at examples of existing sentences**, i.e. by being **trained on a corpus**. Throughout Parts 2 and 3, you will look at **different ways of estimating these probabilities**. In each case, you will use a corpus to assign probabilities to different tokens and combinations of tokens, and use those probabilities to generate new sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each language model you build will be a **class** with a few methods in common:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `__init__` constructor: when you instantiate an LM object, you will need to pass the \"training corpus\" on which your model will be trained (i.e. a list of tokens you created in Question 2 with `tokenize`). The `train` method will then use that data to create a model which is saved in the `mdl` attribute. This code is given to you.\n",
    "* The `train` method takes in a list of tokens (e.g. the output of `tokenize`) and outputs a language model. **This language model is represented as a `Series`, whose index consists of tokens and whose values are the probabilities that the tokens occur.** (In the case of the N-Gram model in Part 3/Question 5, the model will be represented as a DataFrame instead of a Series – more on this later.)\n",
    "* The `probability` method takes in a sequence of tokens and returns the probability that this sequence occurs under the language model.\n",
    "* The `sample` method takes in a positive integer `M` and generates a string made up of `M` tokens using the language model. **This method generates random sentences!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The description of Question 3 walks through in detail how each of these methods work. However, here's the general workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{initialize LM with tokenized corpus} \\rightarrow \\text{train LM (i.e. assign probabilities to each token) using corpus} \\rightarrow \\text{used trained LM to compute probabilities of input sentences and generate random sentences}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Questions 3, 4, and 5, you will create classes for different language models – uniform, unigram, and N-Gram, respectively. In each class, you will implement each of the above methods."

    "### Question 3 – Uniform Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='question3'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A uniform language model is one in which each **unique** word is equally likely to appear in any position, unconditional of any other information.\n",

    "Let's put into context what this means by using the following example corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">>> corpus = 'when I eat pizza, I smile, but when I drink Coke, my stomach hurts'\n",
    ">>> tokenize(corpus)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a tokenized corpus, you need to build the language model itself in `train`. As mentioned above, language models are stored as Series, where words are the index and probabilities are the values. **In a uniform language model**, the probability assigned to each token is **1 over the total number of unique tokens in the corpus**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example corpus above has 14 **unique** tokens. This means that we'd have $P(\\text{\\x02}) = \\frac{1}{14}$, $P(\\text{when}) = \\frac{1}{14}$, and so on. Specifically, in this example, **the Series that `train` returns should contain the following values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Token | Probability |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `'\\x02'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'when'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",

    "| `'my'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'stomach'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'hurts'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'\\x03'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that:\n",
    "- **None of the probabilities we computed are conditional – the uniform model does not use conditional probabilities!**\n",
    "- When looking at the Series that `train` returns (i.e. when looking at the `mdl` attribute), the `'\\x02'` and `'\\x03'` characters will show up as blank characters in the index. This is to be expected.\n",
    "- Your Series doesn't need to have the labels `'Token'` or `'Probability'` in it, like the above table does.\n",

    "After training the model, you need to implement two more methods, `probability` and `sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`probability` should take in any tuple of tokens and use the probabilities you computed in `train` (that are stored in the `mdl` attribute) to assign a probability to that sequence. For instance, suppose the input tuple is `('when', 'I', 'drink', 'Coke', 'I', 'smile')` (note that this tuple does not need to start with `'\\x02'` or end with `'\\x03'`). To compute the probability of this tuple under our language model, we would multiply the \"trained\" probabilities for each word individually. Here that would give us \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile}) = P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{I}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{14} \\right)^6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the input tuple contains a token that was not in our corpus, `probability` should return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `sample` should take in a positive integer, `M`, and return a sentence made up of `M` randomly sampled tokens, in which the probabilities come from `mdl`. For instance, if `M=5`, then we'd return a sentence containing 5 randomly selected tokens from the table above, such that the probability that each token is selected is $\\frac{1}{14}$. The sampling is done with replacement, so we could end up with the same token multiple times. For instance, we might end up with `'but drink smile drink hurts'`. Note that this sentence doesn't make any grammatical sense (that's okay!) and that tokens are separated by spaces.\n",

    "## Part 3: Creating an N-Gram Language Model 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's recap what we've done so far. Recall the chain rule for probability, where $w$ is a sentence made up of tokens $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Questions 3 (Uniform) and 4 (Unigram), your `train` methods computed these probabilities **unconditionally**, meaning that the probability that a token appeared in a sentence did **not depend** on the other tokens around it. That is, you said $P(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i - 1}) = P(w_i)$. In Question 3, you let $P(w_i) = \\frac{1}{\\text{# unique tokens in corpus}}$, and in Question 4, you let $P(w_i) = \\frac{\\text{# tokens in corpus equal to $w_i$}}{\\text{# tokens in corpus}}$. Cruciually, each probability was determined by looking at the corpus that the model was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-Gram Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will build an N-Gram language model, in which the probability of a token appearing in a sentence **does depend** on the tokens that come before it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule above specifies that the probability that a token occurs at in a particular position in a sentence depends on **all** previous tokens in the sentence. However, it is often the case that the likelihood that a token appears in a sentence is influenced more by **nearby** tokens. (Remember, tokens are words, punctuation, or `'\\x02'` / `'\\x03'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-Gram language model relies on the assumption that only nearby tokens matter. Specifically, it assumes that the probability that a token occurs depends only on the previous $N-1$ tokens, rather than all previous tokens. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1}) = P(w_n|w_{n-(N-1)},\\ldots,w_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In an N-Gram language model, there is a hyperparameter that we get to choose when creating the model, $N$. For any $N$, the resulting N-Gram model looks at the previous $N-1$ tokens when computing probabilities. (Note that the unigram model you built in Question 4 is really an N-Gram model with $N=1$, since it looked at 0 previous tokens when computing probabilities.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Trigram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When $N=3$, we have a \"trigram\" model. Such a model looks at the previous $N-1 = 2$ tokens when computing probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the tuple `('when', 'I', 'drink', 'Coke', 'I', 'smile')`, corresponding to the sentence `'when I drink Coke I smile'`. Under the trigram model, the probability of this sentence is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile}) = P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink | when I}) \\cdot P(\\text{Coke | I drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | drink Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile | Coke I})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The trigram model doesn't consider the beginning of the sentence when computing the probability that the sentence ends in `'smile'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### N-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "Both when working with a training corpus and when implementing the `probability` method to compute the probabilities of other sentences, you will need to work with \"chunks\" of $N$ tokens at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The **N-Grams of a text** are a list of tuples containing sliding windows of length $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the trigrams in the sentence `'when I drink Coke I smile'` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "[('when', 'I', 'drink'), ('I', 'drink', 'Coke'), ('drink', 'Coke', 'I'), ('Coke', 'I', 'smile')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computing N-Gram Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in our trigram model above, we computed $P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile})$ as being the product of several conditional probabilities. These conditional probabilities are the result of **training** our N-Gram model on a training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an N-Gram model, we must compute a conditional probability for every $N$-token sequence in the corpus. For instance, suppose again that we are training a trigram model. Then, for every 3-token sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$, we must compute $P(w_3 | w_1, w_2)$. To do so, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_3 | w_1, w_2) = \\frac{C(w_1, w_2, w_3)}{C(w_1, w_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C(w_1, w_2, w_3)$ is the number of occurrences of the trigram sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$ in the training corpus and $C(w_1, w_2)$ is the number of occurrences of the bigram sequence  $w_1, w_2$ in the training corpus. (Technical note: the probabilities that we compute using the ratios of counts are _estimates_ of the true conditional probabilities of N-Grams in the population of corpuses from which our corpus was drawn.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for any $N$, conditional probabilities are computed by dividing the counts of N-Grams by the counts of the (N-1)-Grams they follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In the description of Question 5.2 we provide a detailed example of how we might compute such probabilities.**\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `NGramLM` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NGramLM` class contains a few extra methods and attributes beyond those of `UniformLM` and `UnigramLM`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiating `NGramLM` requires both a list of tokens and a positive integer `N`, specifying the N in N-grams. This parameter is stored in an attribute `N`.\n",
    "1. The `NGramLM` class has a method `create_ngrams` that takes in a list of tokens and returns a list of N-Grams (recall from above, an N-Gram is a **tuple** of length N). This list of N-Grams is then passed to the `train` method to train the N-Gram model.\n",
    "1. While the `train` method still creates a language model (in this case, an N-Gram model) and stores it in the `mdl` attribute, this model is most naturally stored as a DataFrame. This DataFrame will have three columns:\n",
    "    - `'ngram'`, containing the N-Grams found in the text.\n",
    "    - `'n1gram'`, containing the (N-1)-Grams upon which the N-Grams in `ngram` are built.\n",
    "    - `'prob'`, containing the probabilities of each N-Gram in `ngram`.\n",
    "1. The `NGramLM` class has an attribute `prev_mdl` that stores an (N-1)-Gram language model over the same corpus (which in turn will store an (N-2)-Gram language model over the same corpus, and so on). This is necessary to compute the probability that a word occurs at the start of a text. This code is included for you in the constructor."

    "### Question 5.4 – Sampling from the N-Gram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='question5d'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method you implemented in the `UniformLM` and `UnigramLM` classes was `sample`, which gave you a way of generating new sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will implement the `sample` method in the `NGramLM` class. It should take in a positive integer `M` and generate a string of M tokens using the trained language model. It should begin with a starting token `'\\x02'`, then generate subsequent tokens from the probabilities in `self.mdl` and continue picking words conditional on the previous choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate how sampling works using a small concrete example. Suppose our corpus and **trigram** model are defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">>> short_corpus = 'zebras eat green peas \\n\\n cows eat green grass \\n\\n zebras eat green peppers'\n",
    ">>> short_tokens = tokenize(short_corpus)\n",
    ">>> short_tokens\n",
    "['\\x02', 'zebras', 'eat', 'green', 'peas', '\\x03', '\\x02', 'cows', 'eat', 'green', 'grass', '\\x03', '\\x02', 'zebras', 'eat', 'green', 'peppers', '\\x03']\n",
    ">>> grass_model = NGramLM(3, short_tokens)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are told to execute `grass_model.sample(5)`. Here's how we'd proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. The first character in the output is `'\\x02'`, as specified above. **We won't count `'\\x02'` in the length of our output string**, so we still need to find 5 more tokens.\n",
    "1. The next character needs to be either `'zebras'` or `'cows'`, since `('\\x02', 'zebras')` and `('\\x02', 'cows')` are the only **bigrams** in `short_tokens` that start with an `'\\x02'`. $P(\\text{zebras | \\x02})$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $P(\\text{cows | \\x02})$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, so we select either `'zebras'` or `'cows'` for our next token according to these probabilities. For the sake of example, suppose we select `'cows'`. 4 more tokens to go.\n",
    "2. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('\\x02', 'cows')`. There is just one, `('\\x02', 'cows', 'eat')`, so our next token must be `'eat'`. 3 more tokens to go.\n",
    "3. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('cows', 'eat')`. Again, there is just one, `('cows', 'eat', 'green')`, so our next token must be `'green'`. 2 more tokens to go.\n",
    "4. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('eat', 'green')`. There are three options – `('eat', 'green', 'peas')`, `('eat', 'green', 'grass')`, and `('eat', 'green', 'peppers')`. Since $P(\\text{peas | eat green}) = P(\\text{grass | eat green}) = P(\\text{peppers | eat green}) = \\frac{1}{3}$, we pick either `'peas'`, `'grass'`, or `'peppers'` uniformly at random. For the sake of example, suppose we select `'peppers'`. 1 more token to go.\n",
    "5. We must end the output string now with `'\\x03'`, putting us at `'\\x02'` plus 5 tokens, which is the number of tokens we were told to sample. Note that `'\\x03'` **does** count towards the number of tokens we were asked to sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our result is `'\\x02 cows eat green peppers \\x03'`. **Note that in our training corpus we never encountered an instance of cows 🐄 eating green peppers 🫑, but we were able to generate a coherent sentence in which they did – pretty cool!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidance:\n",
    "- If you run into a situation where there are no N-Grams that match the most recent (N-1)-Gram, you should add `'\\x03'` (STOP) token as the next token in your output sentence. There is a chance that your sampled sentence ends in many `'\\x03'`s, and that's fine.\n",
    "- Helper functions and recursion will be very helpful.\n",
