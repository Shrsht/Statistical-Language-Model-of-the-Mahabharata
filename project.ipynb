    "## About the Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Language Models (LM)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build *[statistical language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model)* using public domain books found on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Language models attempt to capture the likelihood that a given sequence of words occur in a given \"language\" (the precise term is \"corpus\" or \"corpora\"). Here, \"language\" is a broad term that, in addition to the normal usage, may mean the language of a particular author or style. As with all statistical models, the true data generating process is never known and thus we cannot know the true probability that a sequence of words will occur – however, we can estimate these probabilities via various methods, some of which are more reliable than others. For example, one might guess that the probability of a sentence is simply the product of the empirical probabilities (i.e., the number of times a word is observed in a dataset divided by the number of words in that dataset). This is one of the methods of estimating the probability of a sequence of words that you will implement in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizing Corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the probabilities of a language model from a book requires breaking up the text of book into sequences of words. This process is called *tokenization*. In reality though, the sequences are not made up entirely of words, but rather more general terms called *tokens*. In this project tokens will include not only whole words, but also punctuation and other terms. Below are a few examples of other types of tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Punctuation. For example, the period makes sense as a token, as certain words tend to end sentences (i.e. appear right before a `'.'`), while other words tend to begin sentences (i.e. appear right after a `'.'`).\n",
    "* We have special \"START\" and \"END\" tokens that begin and end every word sequence (in our case, paragraphs of words in a given book). These make sense as tokens, as certain words may tend to begin and end paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful for the tokens used to represent START and END to be single characters that can never be found in the text of the book you use to create your language model. Thus, you will use two ASCII hidden \"[control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C0_(ASCII_and_derivatives))\":\n",
    "* For START, you will use the character `'\\x02'`, which refers to the \"beginning of text\".\n",
    "* For END, you will use the character `'\\x03'`, which refers to the \"end of text\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on Checking Your Work for Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a language model, you will need to perform several steps, from data cleaning to implementing mathematical formulas. **Things will get messy, and it can be difficult to assess the correctness of your work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The doctests will include checks on the inputs and outputs of your methods.\n",
    "- The `grade.check` public notebook tests will be **more informative** than the doctests, but they still won't guarantee that your code is correct.\n",
    "- The doctests include small-enough examples that you should be able to determine the correct outputs (e.g. probabilities) by hand.\n",
    "- Run your functions on **real books** taken from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and make sure that their behavior looks correct. After selecting a book, click the \"Plain Text UTF-8\" link to find the book's text ([example](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/68085/pg68085.txt))."

       " \"The object of a translator should ever be to hold the mirror up to his\\nauthor. That being so, his chief duty is to represent so far as\\npracticable the manner in which his author's ideas have been expressed,\\nretaining if possible at the sacrifice of idiom and taste all the\\npeculiarities of his author's imagery and of language as well. In regard\\nto translations from the Sanskrit, nothing is easier than to dish up Hindu\\nideas, so as to make them agreeable to English taste. But the endeavour of\\nthe present translator has been to give in the following pages as literal\\na rendering as possible of the great work of Vyasa. To the purely English\\nreader there is much in the following pages that will strike as ridiculous.\\nThose unacquainted with any language but their own are generally very\\nexclusive in matters of taste. Having no knowledge of models other than\\nwhat they meet with in their own tongue, the standard they have formed of\\npurity and taste in composition must necessarily be a narrow one. The\\ntranslator, however, would ill-discharge his duty, if for the sake of\\navoiding ridicule, he sacrificed fidelity to the original. He must\\nrepresent his author as he is, not as he should be to please the narrow\\ntaste of those entirely unacquainted with him. Mr. Pickford, in the\\npreface to his English translation of the Mahavira Charita, ably defends a\\nclose adherence to the original even at the sacrifice of idiom and taste\\nagainst the claims of what has been called 'Free Translation,' which means\\ndressing the author in an outlandish garb to please those to whom he is\\nintroduced.\",\n",
       " 'In the preface to his classical translation of Bhartrihari\\'s Niti Satakam\\nand Vairagya Satakam, Mr. C.H. Tawney says, \"I am sensible that in the\\npresent attempt I have retained much local colouring. For instance, the\\nideas of worshipping the feet of a god or great men, though it frequently\\noccurs in Indian literature, will undoubtedly move the laughter of\\nEnglishmen unacquainted with Sanskrit, especially if they happen to belong\\nto that class of readers who revel their attention on the accidental and\\nremain blind to the essential. But a certain measure of fidelity to the\\noriginal even at the risk of making oneself ridiculous, is better than the\\nstudied dishonesty which characterises so many translations of oriental\\npoets.\"',\n",
       " \"We fully subscribe to the above although, it must be observed, the censure\\nconveyed to the class of translators last indicated is rather undeserved,\\nthere being nothing like a 'studied dishonesty' in their efforts which\\nproceed only from a mistaken view of their duties and as such betray only\\nan error of the head but not of the heart. More than twelve years ago when\\nBabu Pratapa Chandra Roy, with Babu Durga Charan Banerjee, went to my\\nretreat at Seebpore, for engaging me to translate the Mahabharata into\\nEnglish, I was amazed with the grandeur of the scheme. My first question\\nto him was,--whence was the money to come, supposing my competence for the\\ntask. Pratapa then unfolded to me the details of his plan, the hopes he\\ncould legitimately cherish of assistance from different quarters. He was\\nfull of enthusiasm. He showed me Dr. Rost's letter, which, he said, had\\nsuggested to him the undertaking. I had known Babu Durga Charan for many\\nyears and I had the highest opinion of his scholarship and practical good\\nsense. When he warmly took Pratapa's side for convincing me of the\\npracticability of the scheme, I listened to him patiently. The two were\\nfor completing all arrangements with me the very day. To this I did not\\nagree. I took a week's time to consider. I consulted some of my literary\\nfriends, foremost among whom was the late lamented Dr. Sambhu C.\\nMookherjee. The latter, I found, had been waited upon by Pratapa. Dr.\\nMookherjee spoke to me of Pratapa as a man of indomitable energy and\\nperseverance. The result of my conference with Dr. Mookherjee was that I\\nwrote to Pratapa asking him to see me again. In this second interview\\nestimates were drawn up, and everything was arranged as far as my portion\\nof the work was concerned. My friend left with me a specimen of\\ntranslation which he had received from Professor Max Muller. This I began\\nto study, carefully comparing it sentence by sentence with the original.\\nAbout its literal character there could be no doubt, but it had no flow\\nand, therefore, could not be perused with pleasure by the general reader.\\nThe translation had been executed thirty years ago by a young German\\nfriend of the great Pundit. I had to touch up every sentence. This I did\\nwithout at all impairing faithfulness to the original. My first 'copy' was\\nset up in type and a dozen sheets were struck off. These were submitted to\\nthe judgment of a number of eminent writers, European and native. All of\\nthem, I was glad to see, approved of the specimen, and then the task of\\ntranslating the Mahabharata into English seriously began.\",\n",
       " \"Before, however, the first fasciculus could be issued, the question as to\\nwhether the authorship of the translation should be publicly owned, arose.\\nBabu Pratapa Chandra Roy was against anonymity. I was for it. The reasons\\nI adduced were chiefly founded upon the impossibility of one person\\ntranslating the whole of the gigantic work. Notwithstanding my resolve to\\ndischarge to the fullest extent the duty that I took up, I might not live\\nto carry it out. It would take many years before the end could be reached.\\nOther circumstances than death might arise in consequence of which my\\nconnection with the work might cease. It could not be desirable to issue\\nsuccessive fasciculus with the names of a succession of translators\\nappearing on the title pages. These and other considerations convinced my\\nfriend that, after all, my view was correct. It was, accordingly, resolved\\nto withhold the name of the translator. As a compromise, however, between\\nthe two views, it was resolved to issue the first fasciculus with two\\nprefaces, one over the signature of the publisher and the other headed--\\n'Translator's Preface.' This, it was supposed, would effectually guard\\nagainst misconceptions of every kind. No careful reader would then\\nconfound the publisher with the author.\",\n",
       " \"Although this plan was adopted, yet before a fourth of the task had been\\naccomplished, an influential Indian journal came down upon poor Pratapa\\nChandra Roy and accused him openly of being a party to a great literary\\nimposture, viz., of posing before the world as the translator of Vyasa's\\nwork when, in fact, he was only the publisher. The charge came upon my\\nfriend as a surprise, especially as he had never made a secret of the\\nauthorship in his correspondence with Oriental scholars in every part of\\nthe world. He promptly wrote to the journal in question, explaining the\\nreasons there were for anonymity, and pointing to the two prefaces with\\nwhich the first fasciculus had been given to the world. The editor readily\\nadmitted his mistake and made a satisfactory apology.\",\n",
       " 'Now that the translation has been completed, there can no longer be any\\nreason for withholding the name of the translator. The entire translation\\nis practically the work of one hand. In portions of the Adi and the Sabha\\nParvas, I was assisted by Babu Charu Charan Mookerjee. About four forms of\\nthe Sabha Parva were done by Professor Krishna Kamal Bhattacharya, and\\nabout half a fasciculus during my illness, was done by another hand. I\\nshould however state that before passing to the printer the copy received\\nfrom these gentlemen I carefully compared every sentence with the original,\\nmaking such alterations as were needed for securing a uniformity of style\\nwith the rest of the work.',\n",
       " 'I should here observe that in rendering the Mahabharata into English I\\nhave derived very little aid from the three Bengali versions that are\\nsupposed to have been executed with care. Every one of these is full of\\ninaccuracies and blunders of every description. The Santi in particular\\nwhich is by far the most difficult of the eighteen Parvas, has been made a\\nmess of by the Pundits that attacked it. Hundreds of ridiculous blunders\\ncan be pointed out in both the Rajadharma and the Mokshadharma sections.\\nSome of these I have pointed out in footnotes.',\n",
       " \"I cannot lay claim to infallibility. There are verses in the Mahabharata\\nthat are exceedingly difficult to construe. I have derived much aid from\\nthe great commentator Nilakantha. I know that Nilakantha's authority is\\nnot incapable of being challenged. But when it is remembered that the\\ninterpretations given by Nilakantha came down to him from preceptors of\\nolden days, one should think twice before rejecting Nilakantha as a guide.\",\n",
       " 'About the readings I have adopted, I should say that as regards the first\\nhalf of the work, I have generally adhered to the Bengal texts; as regards\\nthe latter half, to the printed Bombay edition. Sometimes individual\\nsections, as occurring in the Bengal editions, differ widely, in respect\\nof the order of the verses, from the corresponding ones in the Bombay\\nedition. In such cases I have adhered to the Bengal texts, convinced that\\nthe sequence of ideas has been better preserved in the Bengal editions\\nthan the Bombay one.',\n",
       " \"I should express my particular obligations to Pundit Ram Nath Tarkaratna,\\nthe author of 'Vasudeva Vijayam' and other poems, Pundit Shyama Charan\\nKaviratna, the learned editor of Kavyaprakasha with the commentary of\\nProfessor Mahesh Chandra Nayaratna, and Babu Aghore Nath Banerjee, the\\nmanager of the Bharata Karyalaya. All these scholars were my referees on\\nall points of difficulty. Pundit Ram Nath's solid scholarship is known to\\nthem that have come in contact with him. I never referred to him a\\ndifficulty that he could not clear up. Unfortunately, he was not always at\\nhand to consult. Pundit Shyama Charan Kaviratna, during my residence at\\nSeebpore, assisted me in going over the Mokshadharma sections of the Santi\\nParva. Unostentatious in the extreme, Kaviratna is truly the type of a\\nlearned Brahman of ancient India. Babu Aghore Nath Banerjee also has from\\ntime to time, rendered me valuable assistance in clearing my difficulties.\",\n",
       " 'Gigantic as the work is, it would have been exceedingly difficult for me\\nto go on with it if I had not been encouraged by Sir Stuart Bayley, Sir\\nAuckland Colvin, Sir Alfred Croft, and among Oriental scholars, by the\\nlate lamented Dr. Reinhold Rost, and Mons. A. Barth of Paris. All these\\neminent men knew from the beginning that the translation was proceeding\\nfrom my pen. Notwithstanding the enthusiasm, with which my poor friend,\\nPratapa Chandra Roy, always endeavoured to fill me. I am sure my energies\\nwould have flagged and patience exhausted but for the encouraging words\\nwhich I always received from these patrons and friends of the enterprise.',\n",
       " 'Lastly, I should name my literary chief and friend, Dr. Sambhu C.\\nMookherjee. The kind interest he took in my labours, the repeated\\nexhortations he addressed to me inculcating patience, the care with which\\nhe read every fasciculus as it came out, marking all those passages which\\nthrew light upon topics of antiquarian interest, and the words of praise\\nhe uttered when any expression particularly happy met his eyes, served to\\nstimulate me more than anything else in going on with a task that\\nsometimes seemed to me endless.',\n",

       " 'Sauti said, \"Having heard the diverse sacred and wonderful stories which\\nwere composed in his Mahabharata by Krishna-Dwaipayana, and which were\\nrecited in full by Vaisampayana at the Snake-sacrifice of the high-souled\\nroyal sage Janamejaya and in the presence also of that chief of Princes,\\nthe son of Parikshit, and having wandered about, visiting many sacred\\nwaters and holy shrines, I journeyed to the country venerated by the\\nDwijas (twice-born) and called Samantapanchaka where formerly was fought\\nthe battle between the children of Kuru and Pandu, and all the chiefs of\\nthe land ranged on either side. Thence, anxious to see you, I am come into\\nyour presence. Ye reverend sages, all of whom are to me as Brahma; ye\\ngreatly blessed who shine in this place of sacrifice with the splendour of\\nthe solar fire: ye who have concluded the silent meditations and have fed\\nthe holy fire; and yet who are sitting--without care, what, O ye Dwijas\\n(twice-born), shall I repeat, shall I recount the sacred stories collected\\nin the Puranas containing precepts of religious duty and of worldly profit,\\nor the acts of illustrious saints and sovereigns of mankind?\"',\n",
       " 'The Rishi replied, \"The Purana, first promulgated by the great Rishi\\nDwaipayana, and which after having been heard both by the gods and the\\nBrahmarshis was highly esteemed, being the most eminent narrative that\\nexists, diversified both in diction and division, possessing subtile\\nmeanings logically combined, and gleaned from the Vedas, is a sacred work.\\nComposed in elegant language, it includeth the subjects of other books. It\\nis elucidated by other Shastras, and comprehendeth the sense of the four\\nVedas. We are desirous of hearing that history also called Bharata, the\\nholy composition of the wonderful Vyasa, which dispelleth the fear of evil,\\njust as it was cheerfully recited by the Rishi Vaisampayana, under the\\ndirection of Dwaipayana himself, at the snake-sacrifice of Raja\\nJanamejaya.\"',\n",
       " 'Sauti then said, \"Having bowed down to the primordial being Isana, to\\nwhom multitudes make offerings, and who is adored by the multitude; who is\\nthe true incorruptible one, Brahma, perceptible, imperceptible, eternal;\\nwho is both a non-existing and an existing-non-existing being; who is the\\nuniverse and also distinct from the existing and non-existing universe;\\nwho is the creator of high and low; the ancient, exalted, inexhaustible\\none; who is Vishnu, beneficent and the beneficence itself, worthy of all\\npreference, pure and immaculate; who is Hari, the ruler of the faculties,\\nthe guide of all things moveable and immoveable; I will declare the sacred\\nthoughts of the illustrious sage Vyasa, of marvellous deeds and worshipped\\nhere by all. Some bards have already published this history, some are now\\nteaching it, and others, in like manner, will hereafter promulgate it upon\\nthe earth. It is a great source of knowledge, established throughout the\\nthree regions of the world. It is possessed by the twice-born both in\\ndetailed and compendious forms. It is the delight of the learned for being\\nembellished with elegant expressions, conversations human and divine, and\\na variety of poetical measures.',\n",
       " '\"In this world, when it was destitute of brightness and light, and\\nenveloped all around in total darkness, there came into being, as the\\nprimal cause of creation, a mighty egg, the one inexhaustible seed of all\\ncreated beings. It is called Mahadivya, and was formed at the beginning of\\nthe Yuga, in which we are told, was the true light Brahma, the eternal one,\\nthe wonderful and inconceivable being present alike in all places; the\\ninvisible and subtile cause, whose nature partaketh of entity and non-\\nentity. From this egg came out the lord Pitamaha Brahma, the one only\\nPrajapati; with Suraguru and Sthanu. Then appeared the twenty-one\\nPrajapatis, viz., Manu, Vasishtha and Parameshthi; ten Prachetas, Daksha,\\nand the seven sons of Daksha. Then appeared the man of inconceivable\\nnature whom all the Rishis know and so the Viswe-devas, the Adityas, the\\nVasus, and the twin Aswins; the Yakshas, the Sadhyas, the Pisachas, the\\nGuhyakas, and the Pitris. After these were produced the wise and most holy\\nBrahmarshis, and the numerous Rajarshis distinguished by every noble\\nquality. So the water, the heavens, the earth, the air, the sky, the\\npoints of the heavens, the years, the seasons, the months, the fortnights,\\ncalled Pakshas, with day and night in due succession. And thus were\\nproduced all things which are known to mankind.',\n",
       " '\"And what is seen in the universe, whether animate or inanimate, of created\\nthings, will at the end of the world, and after the expiration of the Yuga,\\nbe again confounded. And, at the commencement of other Yugas, all things\\nwill be renovated, and, like the various fruits of the earth, succeed each\\nother in the due order of their seasons. Thus continueth perpetually to\\nrevolve in the world, without beginning and without end, this wheel which\\ncauseth the destruction of all things.',\n",
       " '\"The generation of Devas, in brief, was thirty-three thousand, thirty-three\\nhundred and thirty-three. The sons of Div were Brihadbhanu, Chakshus, Atma,\\nVibhavasu, Savita, Richika, Arka, Bhanu, Asavaha, and Ravi. Of these\\nVivaswans of old, Mahya was the youngest whose son was Deva-vrata. The\\nlatter had for his son, Su-vrata who, we learn, had three sons,--Dasa-\\njyoti, Sata-jyoti, and Sahasra-jyoti, each of them producing numerous\\noffspring. The illustrious Dasa-jyoti had ten thousand, Sata-jyoti ten\\ntimes that number, and Sahasra-jyoti ten times the number of Sata-jyoti\\'s\\noffspring. From these are descended the family of the Kurus, of the Yadus,\\nand of Bharata; the family of Yayati and of Ikshwaku; also of all the\\nRajarshis. Numerous also were the generations produced, and very abundant\\nwere the creatures and their places of abode. The mystery which is\\nthreefold--the Vedas, Yoga, and Vijnana Dharma, Artha, and Kama--also\\nvarious books upon the subject of Dharma, Artha, and Kama; also rules for\\nthe conduct of mankind; also histories and discourses with various srutis;\\nall of which having been seen by the Rishi Vyasa are here in due order\\nmentioned as a specimen of the book.',\n",
       " '\"The Rishi Vyasa published this mass of knowledge in both a detailed and an\\nabridged form. It is the wish of the learned in the world to possess the\\ndetails and the abridgement. Some read the Bharata beginning with the\\ninitial mantra (invocation), others with the story of Astika, others with\\nUparichara, while some Brahmanas study the whole. Men of learning display\\ntheir various knowledge of the institutes in commenting on the composition.\\nSome are skilful in explaining it, while others, in remembering its\\ncontents.',\n",
       " '\"The son of Satyavati having, by penance and meditation, analysed the\\neternal Veda, afterwards composed this holy history, when that learned\\nBrahmarshi of strict vows, the noble Dwaipayana Vyasa, offspring of\\nParasara, had finished this greatest of narrations, he began to consider\\nhow he might teach it to his disciples. And the possessor of the six\\nattributes, Brahma, the world\\'s preceptor, knowing of the anxiety of the\\nRishi Dwaipayana, came in person to the place where the latter was, for\\ngratifying the saint, and benefiting the people. And when Vyasa,\\nsurrounded by all the tribes of Munis, saw him, he was surprised; and,\\nstanding with joined palms, he bowed and ordered a seat to be brought. And\\nVyasa having gone round him who is called Hiranyagarbha seated on that\\ndistinguished seat stood near it; and being commanded by Brahma\\nParameshthi, he sat down near the seat, full of affection and smiling in\\njoy. Then the greatly glorious Vyasa, addressing Brahma Parameshthi, said,\\n\\'O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly\\nrespected. The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been\\nexplained by me; the various rituals of the Upanishads with the Angas; the\\ncompilation of the Puranas and history formed by me and named after the\\nthree divisions of time, past, present, and future; the determination of\\nthe nature of decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence, a\\ndescription of creeds and of the various modes of life; rule for the four\\ncastes, and the import of all the Puranas; an account of asceticism and of\\nthe duties of a religious student; the dimensions of the sun and moon, the\\nplanets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of the four\\nages; the Rik, Sama and Yajur Vedas; also the Adhyatma; the sciences\\ncalled Nyaya, Orthoephy and Treatment of diseases; charity and\\nPasupatadharma; birth celestial and human, for particular purposes; also a\\ndescription of places of pilgrimage and other holy places of rivers,\\nmountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas; the art\\nof war; the different kinds of nations and languages: the nature of the\\nmanners of the people; and the all-pervading spirit;--all these have been\\nrepresented. But, after all, no writer of this work is to be found on\\nearth.\\'',\n",
       " '\"Brahma said, \\'I esteem thee for thy knowledge of divine mysteries, before\\nthe whole body of celebrated Munis distinguished for the sanctity of their\\nlives. I know thou hast revealed the divine word, even from its first\\nutterance, in the language of truth. Thou hast called thy present work a\\npoem, wherefore it shall be a poem. There shall be no poets whose works\\nmay equal the descriptions of this poem, even, as the three other modes\\ncalled Asrama are ever unequal in merit to the domestic Asrama. Let Ganesa\\nbe thought of, O Muni, for the purpose of writing the poem.\\'\"',\n",
       " 'Sauti said, \"Brahma having thus spoken to Vyasa, retired to his own abode.\\nThen Vyasa began to call to mind Ganesa. And Ganesa, obviator of obstacles,\\nready to fulfil the desires of his votaries, was no sooner thought of,\\nthan he repaired to the place where Vyasa was seated. And when he had been\\nsaluted, and was seated, Vyasa addressed him thus, \\'O guide of the Ganas!\\nbe thou the writer of the Bharata which I have formed in my imagination,\\nand which I am about to repeat.\\'',\n",
       " '\"Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered, \\'I will become the\\nwriter of thy work, provided my pen do not for a moment cease writing.\\'\\nAnd Vyasa said unto that divinity, \\'Wherever there be anything thou dost\\nnot comprehend, cease to continue writing.\\' Ganesa having signified his\\nassent, by repeating the word Om! proceeded to write; and Vyasa began; and\\nby way of diversion, he knit the knots of composition exceeding close; by\\ndoing which, he dictated this work according to his engagement.',\n",
       " '\"I am\" (continued Sauti) \"acquainted with eight thousand and eight hundred\\nverses, and so is Suka, and perhaps Sanjaya. From the mysteriousness of\\ntheir meaning, O Muni, no one is able, to this day, to penetrate those\\nclosely knit difficult slokas. Even the omniscient Ganesa took a moment to\\nconsider; while Vyasa, however, continued to compose other verses in great\\nabundance.',\n",
       " '\"The wisdom of this work, like unto an instrument of applying collyrium,\\nhath opened the eyes of the inquisitive world blinded by the darkness of\\nignorance. As the sun dispelleth the darkness, so doth the Bharata by its\\ndiscourses on religion, profit, pleasure and final release, dispel the\\nignorance of men. As the full-moon by its mild light expandeth the buds of\\nthe water-lily, so this Purana, by exposing the light of the Sruti hath\\nexpanded the human intellect. By the lamp of history, which destroyeth the\\ndarkness of ignorance, the whole mansion of nature is properly and\\ncompletely illuminated.',\n",

       " 'Sauti continued, \"I will now speak of the undying flowery and fruitful\\nproductions of this tree, possessed of pure and pleasant taste, and not to\\nbe destroyed even by the immortals. Formerly, the spirited and virtuous\\nKrishna-Dwaipayana, by the injunctions of Bhishma, the wise son of Ganga\\nand of his own mother, became the father of three boys who were like the\\nthree fires by the two wives of Vichitra-virya; and having thus raised up\\nDhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, he returned to his recluse abode to\\nprosecute his religious exercise.',\n",
       " '\"It was not till after these were born, grown up, and departed on the\\nsupreme journey, that the great Rishi Vyasa published the Bharata in this\\nregion of mankind; when being solicited by Janamejaya and thousands of\\nBrahmanas, he instructed his disciple Vaisampayana, who was seated near\\nhim; and he, sitting together with the Sadasyas, recited the Bharata,\\nduring the intervals of the ceremonies of the sacrifice, being repeatedly\\nurged to proceed.',\n",
       " '\"Vyasa hath fully represented the greatness of the house of Kuru, the\\nvirtuous principles of Gandhari, the wisdom of Vidura, and the constancy\\nof Kunti. The noble Rishi hath also described the divinity of Vasudeva,\\nthe rectitude of the sons of Pandu, and the evil practices of the sons and\\npartisans of Dhritarashtra.',\n",
       " '\"Vyasa executed the compilation of the Bharata, exclusive of the episodes\\noriginally in twenty-four thousand verses; and so much only is called by\\nthe learned as the Bharata. Afterwards, he composed an epitome in one\\nhundred and fifty verses, consisting of the introduction with the chapter\\nof contents. This he first taught to his son Suka; and afterwards he gave\\nit to others of his disciples who were possessed of the same\\nqualifications. After that he executed another compilation, consisting of\\nsix hundred thousand verses. Of those, thirty hundred thousand are known\\nin the world of the Devas; fifteen hundred thousand in the world of the\\nPitris: fourteen hundred thousand among the Gandharvas, and one hundred\\nthousand in the regions of mankind. Narada recited them to the Devas,\\nDevala to the Pitris, and Suka published them to the Gandharvas, Yakshas,\\nand Rakshasas: and in this world they were recited by Vaisampayana, one of\\nthe disciples of Vyasa, a man of just principles and the first among all\\nthose acquainted with the Vedas.

       " '\"Yudhishthira is a vast tree, formed of religion and virtue; Arjuna is its\\ntrunk; Bhimasena, its branches; the two sons of Madri are its full-grown\\nfruit and flowers; and its roots are Krishna, Brahma, and the Brahmanas.',\n",
       " '\"Pandu, after having subdued many countries by his wisdom and prowess, took\\nup his abode with the Munis in a certain forest as a sportsman, where he\\nbrought upon himself a very severe misfortune for having killed a stag\\ncoupling with its mate, which served as a warning for the conduct of the\\nprinces of his house as long as they lived. Their mothers, in order that\\nthe ordinances of the law might be fulfilled, admitted as substitutes to\\ntheir embraces the gods Dharma, Vayu, Sakra, and the divinities the twin\\nAswins. And when their offspring grew up, under the care of their two\\nmothers, in the society of ascetics, in the midst of sacred groves and\\nholy recluse-abodes of religious men, they were conducted by Rishis into\\nthe presence of Dhritarashtra and his sons, following as students in the\\nhabit of Brahmacharis, having their hair tied in knots on their heads.\\n\\'These our pupils\\', said they, \\'are as your sons, your brothers, and your\\nfriends; they are Pandavas.\\' Saying this, the Munis disappeared.',\n",

       " '\"After a while, Arjuna obtained the virgin Krishna at the swayamvara, in\\nthe midst of a concourse of Rajas, by performing a very difficult feat of\\narchery.

       " '\"Yudhishthira, after having, through the wise counsels of Vasudeva and by\\nthe valour of Bhimasena and Arjuna, slain Jarasandha (the king of Magadha)\\nand the proud Chaidya, acquired the right to perform the grand sacrifice\\nof Rajasuya abounding in provisions and offering and fraught with\\ntranscendent merits.

And when he beheld the hall of\\nassembly elegantly constructed by Maya (the Asura architect) after the\\nfashion of a celestial court, he was inflamed with rage.

In this the high-\\nsouled Vasudeva by reasons based on the philosophy of final release drove\\naway Arjuna\\'s compunction springing from the latter\\'s regard for his\\nkindred (whom he was on the eve of slaying). In this the magnanimous\\nKrishna, attentive to the welfare of Yudhishthira, seeing the loss\\ninflicted (on the Pandava army), descended swiftly from his chariot\\nhimself and ran, with dauntless breast, his driving whip in hand, to\\neffect the death of Bhishma.

       " '\"Then shall I describe the Parva called Sauptika of frightful incidents.\\nOn the Pandavas having gone away, the mighty charioteers, Kritavarman,\\nKripa, and the son of Drona, came to the field of battle in the evening\\nand there saw king Duryodhana lying on the ground, his thighs broken, and\\nhimself covered with blood. Then the great charioteer, the son of Drona,\\nof terrible wrath, vowed, \\'without killing all the Panchalas including\\nDrishtadyumna, and the Pandavas also with all their allies, I will not\\ntake off armour.\\' Having spoken those words, the three warriors leaving\\nDuryodhana\\'s side entered the great forest just as the sun was setting.\\nWhile sitting under a large banian tree in the night, they saw an owl\\nkilling numerous crows one after another. At the sight of this,\\nAswatthaman, his heart full of rage at the thought of his father\\'s fate,\\nresolved to slay the slumbering Panchalas. And wending to the gate of the\\ncamp, he saw there a Rakshasa of frightful visage, his head reaching to\\nthe very heavens, guarding the entrance. And seeing that Rakshasa\\nobstructing all his weapons, the son of Drona speedily pacified by worship\\nthe three-eyed Rudra. And then accompanied by Kritavarman and Kripa he\\nslew all the sons of Draupadi, all the Panchalas with Dhrishtadyumna and\\nothers, together with their relatives, slumbering unsuspectingly in the\\nnight. All perished on that fatal night except the five Pandavas and the\\ngreat warrior Satyaki. Those escaped owing to Krishna\\'s counsels, then the\\ncharioteer of Dhrishtadyumna brought to the Pandavas intelligence of the\\nslaughter of the slumbering Panchalas by the son of Drona. Then Draupadi\\ndistressed at the death of her sons and brothers and father sat before her\\nlords resolved to kill herself by fasting. Then Bhima of terrible prowess,\\nmoved by the words of Draupadi, resolved, to please her; and speedily\\ntaking up his mace followed in wrath the son of his preceptor in arms. The\\nson of Drona from fear of Bhimasena and impelled by the fates and moved\\nalso by anger discharged a celestial weapon saying, \\'This is for the\\ndestruction of all the Pandavas\\'; then Krishna saying. \\'This shall not be\\',\\nneutralised Aswatthaman\\'s speech. Then Arjuna neutralised that weapon by\\none of his own. Seeing the wicked Aswatthaman\\'s destructive intentions,\\nDwaipayana and Krishna pronounced curses on him which the latter returned.\\nPandava then deprived the mighty warrior-in-chariot Aswatthaman, of the\\njewel on his head, and became exceedingly glad, and, boastful of their\\nsuccess, made a present of it to the sorrowing Draupadi.

This is the thirteenth\\nParva which hath laid down accurately the various duties of men. The\\nnumber of sections, in this is one hundred and forty-six. The number of\\nslokas is eight thousand.',\n",

The battles of Arjuna the son of Pandu, while following the\\nsacrificial horse let loose, with various princes who in wrath seized it.\\nThen is shown the great risk of Arjuna in his encounter with Vabhruvahana\\nthe son of Chitrangada (by Arjuna) the appointed daughter of the chief of\\nManipura.

Seeing this, the virtuous Pritha also, ever engaged in cherishing\\nher superiors, leaving the court of her sons, followed the old couple. In\\nthis is described the wonderful meeting through the kindness of Vyasa of\\nthe king (Dhritarashtra) with the spirits of his slain children, grand-\\nchildren, and other princes, returned from the other world.

In this, both\\nBalarama and Kesava (Krishna) after causing the extermination of their\\nrace, their hour having come, themselves did not rise superior to the sway\\nof all-destroying Time. In this, Arjuna the foremost among men, going to\\nDwaravati (Dwaraka) and seeing the city destitute of the Vrishnis was much\\naffected and became exceedingly sorry. Then after the funeral of his\\nmaternal uncle Vasudeva the foremost among the Yadus (Vrishnis), he saw\\nthe heroes of the Yadu race lying stretched in death on the spot where\\nthey had been drinking. He then caused the cremation of the bodies of the\\nillustrious Krishna and Balarama and of the principal members of the\\nVrishni race. Then as he was journeying from Dwaraka with the women and\\nchildren, the old and the decrepit--the remnants of the Yadu race--he was\\nmet on the way by a heavy calamity. He witnessed also the disgrace of his\\nbow Gandiva and the unpropitiousness of his celestial weapons. Seeing all\\nthis, Arjuna became despondent and, pursuant to Vyasa\\'s advice, went to\\nYudhishthira and solicited permission to adopt the Sannyasa mode of life.\\nThis is the sixteenth Parva called Maushala.

Observing the\\nillustrious Yudhishthira\\'s steady adherence to virtue, Dharma (the god of\\njustice) abandoning his canine form showed himself to the king.

And belaboured by the brothers of Janamejaya, he ran\\naway to his mother, crying in pain. And his mother seeing him crying\\nexceedingly asked him, \\'Why criest thou so? Who hath beaten thee?\\' And\\nbeing thus questioned, he said unto his mother, \\'I have been belaboured by\\nthe brothers of Janamejaya.\\' And his mother replied, \\'Thou hast committed\\nsome fault for which hast thou been beaten!\\' He answered, \\'I have not\\ncommitted any fault. I have not touched the sacrificial butter with my\\ntongue, nor have I even cast a look upon it.\\' His mother Sarama hearing\\nthis and much distressed at the affliction of her son went to the place\\nwhere Janamejaya with his brothers was at his long-extending sacrifice.\\nAnd she addressed Janamejaya in anger, saying, \\'This my son hath committed\\nno fault: he hath not looked upon your sacrificial butter, nor hath he\\ntouched it with his tongue. Wherefore hath he been beaten?\\' They said not\\na word in reply; whereupon she said, \\'As ye have beaten my son who hath\\ncommitted no fault, therefore shall evil come upon ye, when ye least\\nexpect it.\\'',\n",
       " '\"Janamejaya, thus addressed by the celestial bitch, Sarama, became\\nexceedingly alarmed and dejected.

       " '\"One day Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, while a-hunting, observed in a\\nparticular part of his dominions a hermitage where dwelt a certain Rishi\\nof fame, Srutasrava. He had a son named Somasrava deeply engaged in\\nascetic devotions. Being desirous of appointing that son of the Rishi as\\nhis Purohita, Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, saluted the Rishi and\\naddressed him, saying, \\'O possessor of the six attributes, let this thy\\nson be my purohita.\\' The Rishi thus addressed, answered Janamejaya, \\'O\\nJanamejaya, this my son, deep in ascetic devotions, accomplished in the\\nstudy of the Vedas, and endued with the full force of my asceticism, is\\nborn of (the womb of) a she-snake that had drunk my vital fluid. He is\\nable to absolve thee from all offences save those committed against\\nMahadeva. But he hath one particular habit, viz. he would grant to any\\nBrahmana whatever might be begged of him. If thou canst put up with it,\\nthen thou take him.\\' Janamejaya thus addressed replied to the Rishi, \\'It\\nshall be even so.\\' And accepting him for his Purohita, he returned to his\\ncapital; and he then addressed his brothers saying, \\'This is the person I\\nhave chosen for my spiritual master; whatsoever he may say must be\\ncomplied with by you without examination.\\' And his brothers did as they\\nwere directed. And giving these directions to his brothers, the king\\nmarched towards Takshyashila and brought that country under his authority.',\n",
       " '\"About this time there was a Rishi, Ayoda-Dhaumya by name. And Ayoda-\\nDhaumya had three disciples, Upamanyu, Aruni, and Veda. And the Rishi bade\\none of these disciples, Aruni of Panchala, to go and stop up a breach in\\nthe water-course of a certain field. And Aruni of Panchala, thus ordered\\nby his preceptor, repaired to the spot. And having gone there he saw that\\nhe could not stop up the breach in the water-course by ordinary means. And\\nhe was distressed because he could not do his preceptor\\'s bidding.

       " '\"And having arrived there, he shouted, \\'Ho Aruni of Panchala! Where art\\nthou? Come hither, my child.\\' And Aruni hearing the voice of his preceptor\\nspeedily came out of the water-course and stood before his preceptor. And\\naddressing the latter, Aruni said, \\'Here I am in the breach of the water-\\ncourse. Not having been able to devise any other means, I entered myself\\nfor the purpose of preventing the water running out. It is only upon\\nhearing thy voice that, having left it and allowed the waters to escape, I\\nhave stood before thee. I salute thee, Master; tell me what I have to do.\\'',\n",

By this thou art diminishing the support\\nof others that live by begging. Truly having supported thyself so, thou\\nhast proved thyself covetous.\\' And Upamanyu, having signified his assent\\nto all that his preceptor said, went away to attend the cattle. And having\\nwatched them all day, he returned to his preceptor\\'s house. And he stood\\nbefore his preceptor and saluted him respectfully. And his preceptor\\nobserving that he was still fat, said again unto him, \\'Upamanyu, my child,\\nI take from thee all thou obtainest in alms and thou dost not go a-begging\\na second time, and yet art thou in healthy condition. How dost thou\\nsupport thyself?\\' And Upamanyu, thus questioned, answered, \\'Sir, I now\\nlive upon the milk of these cows.\\' And his preceptor thereupon told him,\\n\\'It is not lawful for thee to appropriate the milk without having first\\nobtained my consent.\\' And Upamanyu having assented to the justice of these\\nobservations, went away to tend the kine. And when he returned to his\\npreceptor\\'s abode, he stood before him and saluted him as usual. And his\\npreceptor seeing that he was still fat, said, \\'Upamanyu, my child, thou\\neatest no longer of alms, nor dost thou go a-begging a second time, not\\neven drinkest of the milk; yet art thou fat. By what means dost thou\\ncontrive to live now?\\' And Upamanyu replied, \\'Sir, I now sip the froth that\\nthese calves throw out, while sucking their mother\\'s teats.\\' And the\\npreceptor said, \\'These generous calves, I suppose, out of compassion for\\nthee, throw out large quantities of froth. Wouldst thou stand in the way\\nof their full meals by acting as thou hast done? Know that it is unlawful\\nfor thee to drink the froth.\\' And Upamanyu, having signified his assent to\\nthis, went as before to tend the cows.

And Upamanyu replied,\\n\\'Having eaten of the leaves of the Arka plant I became blind, and so have\\nI fallen into this well.\\' And his preceptor thereupon told him, \\'Glorify\\nthe twin Aswins, the joint physicians of the gods, and they will restore\\nthee thy sight.\\' And Upamanyu thus directed by his preceptor began to\\nglorify the twin Aswins, in the following words of the Rig Veda:',\n",

Then go thou thy own way.\\' To this Utanka made answer, \\'I showed\\nthee the uncleanliness of the food offered to me, and I was even now\\npacified by thee.

The Asuras held\\nVasuki by the hood and the gods held him by the tail. And Ananta, who was\\non the side of the gods, at intervals raised the snake\\'s hood and suddenly\\nlowered it. And in consequence of the stretch Vasuki received at the hands\\nof the gods and the Asuras, black vapours with flames issued from his\\nmouth.

One day, having pierced a deer with a sharp arrow\\nand slung his bow on his back, he penetrated into the deep forest,\\nsearching for the animal here and there, like the illustrious Rudra\\nhimself of old pursuing in the heavens, bow in hand, the deer which was\\nSacrifice, itself turned into that shape, after the piercing. No deer that\\nwas pierced by Parikshit had ever escaped in the wood with life.

And approaching him\\nhastily, the monarch, hungry and fatigued, and raising his bow, asked that\\nMuni of rigid vows, saying, \\'O Brahmana, I am king Parikshit, the son of\\nAbhimanyu. A deer pierced by me hath been lost.

O sinless one, by accepting your embraces my virginity will be\\nsullied. O best of Brahmanas, my virginity being sullied, how shall I, O\\nRishi, be able to return home? Indeed, I shall not then be able to bear\\nlife. Reflecting upon all this, O illustrious one, do that which should be\\ndone.\" That best of Rishis, gratified with all she said, replied, \"Thou\\nshall remain a virgin even if thou grantest my wish. And, O timid one, O\\nbeauteous lady, solicit the boon that thou desirest. O thou of fair smiles,\\nmy grace hath never before proved fruitless.\" Thus addressed, the maiden\\nasked for the boon that her body might emit a sweet scent (instead of the\\nfish-odour that it had). And the illustrious Rishi thereupon granted that\\nwish of her heart.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Having obtained her boon, she became highly pleased, and her season\\nimmediately came. And she accepted the embraces of that Rishi of wonderful\\ndeeds. And she thenceforth became known among men by the name of\\nGandhavati (the sweet-scented one). And men could perceive her scent from\\nthe distance of a yojana. And for this she was known by another name which\\nwas Yojanagandha (one who scatters her scent for a yojana all around). And\\nthe illustrious Parasara, after this, went to his own asylum.',\n",
       " '\"\\'And Satyavati gratified with having obtained the excellent boon in\\nconsequence of which she became sweet-scented and her virginity remained\\nunsullied conceived through Parasara\\'s embraces.

The son of Jamadagni\\n(Parasurama), after twenty-one times making the earth bereft of Kshatriyas\\nwended to that best of mountains Mahendra and there began his ascetic\\npenances. And at that time when the earth was bereft of Kshatriyas, the\\nKshatriya ladies, desirous of offspring, used to come, O monarch, to the\\nBrahmanas and Brahmanas of rigid vows had connection with them during the\\nwomanly season alone, but never, O king, lustfully and out of season. And\\nKshatriya ladies by thousands conceived from such connection with\\nBrahmanas. Then, O monarch, were born many Kshatriyas of greater energy,\\nboys and girls, so that the Kshatriya race, might thrive. And thus sprang\\nthe Kshatriya race from Kshatriya ladies by Brahmanas of ascetic penances.\\nAnd the new generation, blessed with long life, began to thrive in virtue.\\nAnd thus were the four orders having Brahmanas at their head re-\\nestablished. And every man at that time went in unto his wife during her\\nseason and never from lust and out of season. And, O bull of the Bharata\\nrace, in the same way, other creatures also, even those born in the race\\nof birds went in unto their wives during the season alone. And, O\\nprotector of the earth, hundreds of thousands of creatures were born, and\\nall were virtuous and began to multiply in virtue, all being free from\\nsorrow and disease. And, O thou of the elephant\\'s tread, this wide earth\\nhaving the ocean for her boundaries, with her mountains and woods and\\ntowns, was once more governed by the Kshatriyas. And when the earth began\\nto be again governed virtuously by the Kshatriyas, the other orders having\\nBrahmanas for their first were filled with great joy. And the kings giving\\nup all vices born of lust and anger and justly awarding punishments to\\nthose that deserved them protected the earth. And he of a hundred\\nsacrifices, possessed also of a thousand eyes, beholding that the\\nKshatriya monarchs ruled so virtuously, poured down vivifying showers at\\nproper times and places and blessed all creatures. Then, O king, no one of\\nimmature years died, and none knew a woman before attaining to age. And\\nthus, O bull of the Bharata race, the earth, to the very coasts of the\\nocean, became filled with men that were all long-lived. The Kshatriyas\\nperformed great sacrifices bestowing much wealth. And the Brahmanas also\\nall studied the Vedas with their branches and the Upanishads. And, O king,\\nno Brahmana in those days ever sold the Vedas (i.e., taught for money) or\\never read aloud the Vedas in the presence of a Sudra. The Vaisyas, with\\nthe help of bullocks, caused the earth to be tilled. And they never yoked\\nthe cattle themselves. And they fed with care all cattle that were lean.\\nAnd men never milked kine as long as the calves drank only the milk of\\ntheir dams (without having taken to grass or any other food).

They are Dhatri, Mitra, Aryaman,\\nSakra, Varuna, Ansa, Vaga, Vivaswat, Usha, Savitri, Tvashtri, and Vishnu.\\nThe youngest, however, is superior to them all in merit. Diti had one son\\ncalled Hiranyakasipu. And the illustrious Hiranyakasipu had five sons, all\\nfamous throughout the world. The eldest of them all was Prahlada, the next\\nwas Sahradha; the third was Anuhrada; and after him were Sivi and Vashkala.\\nAnd, O Bharata, it is known everywhere that Prahlada had three sons. They\\nwere Virochana, Kumbha, and Nikumbha. And unto Virochana was born a son,\\nVali, of great prowess. And the son of Vali is known to be the great Asura,\\nVana.

And, O Bharata, the sons and the grandsons of these were known\\nto be countless. And Sinhika gave birth to Rahu, the persecutor of the Sun\\nand the Moon, and to three others, Suchandra, Chandrahantri, and\\nChandrapramardana. And the countless progeny of Krura (krodha) were as\\ncrooked and wicked as herself. And the tribe was wrathful, of crooked\\ndeeds, and persecutors of their foes.

These two were\\nthe sons of Anila. The son of Pratyusha, you must know, is the Rishi named\\nDevala; and Devala had two sons who were both exceedingly forgiving and of\\ngreat mental power. And the sister of Vrihaspati, the first of women,\\nuttering the sacred truth, engaged in ascetic penances, roamed over the\\nwhole earth; and she became the wife of Prabhasa, the eighth Vasu. And she\\nbrought forth the illustrious Viswakarman, the founder of all arts. And he\\nwas the originator of a thousand arts, the engineer of the immortals, the\\nmaker of all kinds of ornaments, and the first of artists. And he it was\\nwho constructed the celestial cars of the gods, and mankind are enabled to\\nlive in consequence of the inventions of that illustrious one.

And the learned Sukra, of great intelligence and wisdom, of\\nrigid vows, leading the life of a Brahmacharin, divided himself in twain\\nby power of asceticism, and became the spiritual guide of both the Daityas\\nand the gods. And after Sukra was thus employed by Brahman in seeking the\\nwelfare (of the gods and the Asuras), Bhrigu begot another excellent son.\\nThis was Chyavana who was like the blazing sun, of virtuous soul, and of\\ngreat fame. And he came out of his mother\\'s womb in anger and became the\\ncause of his mother\\'s release, O king (from the hands of the Rakshasas).\\nAnd Arushi, the daughter of Manu, became the wife of the wise Chyavana.\\nAnd on her was begotten Aurva of great reputation. And he came out,\\nripping open the thigh of Arushi. And Aurva begot Richika. And Richika\\neven in his boyhood became possessed of great power and energy, and of\\nevery virtue. And Richika begot Jamadagni. And the high-souled Jamadagni\\nhad four sons. And the youngest of them all was Rama (Parasurama). And\\nRama was superior to all his brothers in the possession of good qualities.\\nAnd he was skilful in all weapons, and became the slayer of the Kshatriyas.\\nAnd he had his passions under complete control.

And Adharma hath Niriti for his wife, whence the Rakshasas who\\nare called Nairitas (offspring of Niriti). And she hath also three other\\ncruel sons always engaged in sinful deeds. They are Bhaya (fear),\\nMahabhaya (terror), and Mrityu (Death) who is always engaged in slaying\\nevery created thing. And, as he is all-destroying, he hath no wife, and no\\nson. And Tamra brought forth five daughters known throughout the worlds.\\nThey are Kaki (crow), Syeni (hawk), Phasi (hen), Dhritarashtri (goose),\\nand Suki (parrot).

And Sweta begat the large\\nelephant known by the name of Sweta, endued with great speed. And, O king,\\nSurabhi gave birth to two daughters, the amiable Rohini and the far-famed\\nGandharvi. And, O Bharata, she had also two other daughters named Vimala\\nand Anala. From Rohini have sprung all kine, and from Gandharvi all\\nanimals of the horse species. And Anala begat the seven kinds of trees\\nyielding pulpy fruits. (They are the date, the palm, the hintala, the tali,\\nthe little date, the nut, and the cocoanut.)

       " '\"Vaisampayana said, \\'After Dushmanta had left the asylum having made those\\npromises unto Sakuntala, the latter of tapering thighs brought forth a boy\\nof immeasurable energy. And when the child was three years old, he became\\nin splendour like the blazing fire. And, O Janamejaya, he was possessed of\\nbeauty and magnanimity and every accomplishment. And that first of\\nvirtuous men, Kanwa, caused all the rites of religion to be performed in\\nrespect of that intelligent child thriving day by day. And the boy gifted\\nwith pearly teeth and shining locks, capable of slaying lions even then,\\nwith all auspicious signs on his palm, and broad expansive forehead, grew\\nup in beauty and strength. And like unto a celestial child in splendour,\\nhe began to grow up rapidly. And when he was only six years of age, endued\\nwith great strength he used to seize and bind to the trees that stood\\naround that asylum, lions and tigers and bears and buffaloes and elephants.\\nAnd he rode on some animals, and pursued others in sportive mood. The\\ndwellers at Kanwa\\'s asylum thereupon bestowed on him a name. And they said,\\nbecause he seizes and restrains an animals however strong, let him be\\ncalled Sarvadamana (the subduer of all). And it was thus that the boy came\\nto be named Sarvadamana, endued as he was with prowess, and energy and\\nstrength. And the Rishi seeing the boy and marking also his extraordinary\\nacts, told Sakuntala that the time had come for his installation as the\\nheir-apparent. And beholding the strength of the boy, Kanwa commanded his\\ndisciples, saying, \"Bear ye without delay this Sakuntala with her son from\\nthis abode to that of her husband, blessed with every auspicious sign.\\nWomen should not live long in the houses of their paternal or maternal\\nrelations. Such residence is destructive of their reputation, their good\\nconduct, their virtue. Therefore, delay not in bearing her hence.\" These\\ndisciples of the Rishi thereupon, saying \"So be it,\" went towards the city\\nnamed after an elephant (Hastinapura) with Sakuntala and her son ahead of\\nthem. And then she of fair eye-brows, taking with her that boy of\\ncelestial beauty, endued with eyes like lotus petals, left the woods where\\nshe had been first known by Dushmanta. And having approached the king, she\\nwith her boy resembling in splendour the rising sun was introduced to him.\\nAnd the disciples of the Rishi having introduced her, returned to the\\nasylum. And Sakuntala having worshipped the king according to proper form,\\ntold him, \"This is thy son, O king! Let him be installed as thy heir-\\napparent. O king, this child, like unto a celestial, hath been begotten by\\nthee upon me. Therefore, O best of men, fulfil now the promise thou gavest\\nme. Call to mind, O thou of great good fortune, the agreement thou hadst\\nmade on the occasion of thy union with me in the asylum of Kanwa.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'The king, hearing these her words, and remembering everything said, \"I\\ndo not remember anything. Who art thou, O wicked woman in ascetic guise?\\nI do not remember having any connection with thee in respect of Dharma,\\nKama and Arthas. Go or stay or do as thou pleasest.\" Thus addressed by\\nhim, the fair-coloured innocent one became abashed. Grief deprived her\\nof consciousness and she stood for a time like an wooden post. Soon,\\nhowever, her eyes became red like copper and her lips began to quiver.\\nAnd the glances she now and then cast upon the king seemed to burn the\\nlatter. Her rising wrath however, and the fire of her asceticism, she\\nextinguished within herself by an extraordinary effort. Collecting her\\nthoughts in a moment, her heart possessed with sorrow and rage, she thus\\naddressed her lord in anger, looking at him, \"Knowing everything, O\\nmonarch, how thou, like an inferior person, thus say that thou knowest\\nit not? Thy heart is a witness to the truth or falsehood of this matter.\\nTherefore, speak truly without degrading thyself. He who being one thing\\nrepresenteth himself as another thing to others, is like a thief and a\\nrobber of his own self. Of what sin is he not capable? Thou thinkest\\nthat thou alone hast knowledge of thy deed. But knowest thou not that\\nthe Ancient, Omniscient one (Narayana) liveth in thy heart? He knoweth\\nall thy sins, and thou sinnest in His presence. He that sins thinks that\\nnone observes him. But he is observed by the gods and by Him also who is\\nin every heart. The Sun, the Moon, the Air, the Fire, the Earth, the\\nSky, Water, the heart, Yama, the day, the night, both twilights, and\\nDharma, all witness the acts of man. Yama, the son of Surya, takes no\\naccount of the sins of him with whom Narayana the witness of all acts,\\nis gratified. But he with whom Narayana is not gratified is tortured for\\nhis sins by Yama. Him who degradeth himself by representing his self\\nfalsely, the gods never bless. Even his own soul blesseth him not. I am\\na wife devoted to my husband. I have come of my own accord, it is true.\\nBut do not, on that account, treat me with disrespect. I am thy wife\\nand, therefore, deserve to be treated respectfully. Wilt thou not treat\\nme so, because I have come hither of my own accord? In the presence of\\nso many, why dost thou treat me like an ordinary woman? I am not\\ncertainly crying in the wilderness. Dost thou not hear me? But if thou\\nrefuse to do what I supplicate thee for, O Dushmanta, thy head this\\nmoment shall burst into a hundred pieces! The husband entering the womb\\nof the wife cometh out himself in the form of the son. Therefore is the\\nwife called by those cognisant of the Vedas as Jaya (she of whom one is\\nborn). And the son that is so born unto persons cognisant of the Vedic\\nMantras rescueth the spirits of deceased ancestors. And because the son\\nrescueth ancestors from the hell called Put, therefore, hath he been\\ncalled by the Self-create himself as Puttra (the rescuer from Put). By a\\nson one conquereth the three worlds. By a son\\'s son, one enjoyeth\\neternity. And by a grandson\\'s son great-grand-fathers enjoy everlasting\\nhappiness. She is a true wife who is skilful in household affairs. She\\nis a true wife who hath borne a son. She is a true wife whose heart is\\ndevoted to her lord. She is a true wife who knoweth none but her lord.\\nThe wife is a man\\'s half. The wife is the first of friends. The wife is\\nthe root of religion, profit, and desire. The wife is the root of\\nsalvation. They that have wives can perform religious acts. They that\\nhave wives can lead domestic lives. They that have wives have the means\\nto be cheerful. They that have wives can achieve good fortune.\\nSweet-speeched wives are friends on occasions of joy. They are as\\nfathers on occasions of religious acts. They are mothers in sickness and\\nwoe. Even in the deep woods to a traveller a wife is his refreshment and\\nsolace. He that hath a wife is trusted by all. A wife, therefore, is\\none\\'s most valuable possession. Even when the husband leaving this world\\ngoeth into the region of Yama, it is the devoted wife that accompanies\\nhim thither. A wife going before waits for the husband. But if the\\nhusband goeth before, the chaste wife followeth close. For these\\nreasons, O king, doth marriage exist. The husband enjoyeth the\\ncompanionship of the wife both in this and in the other worlds. It hath\\nbeen said by learned persons that one is himself born as one\\'s son.\\nTherefore, a man whose wife hath borne a son should look upon her as his\\nmother. Beholding the face of the son one hath begotten upon his wife,\\nlike his own face in a mirror, one feeleth as happy as a virtuous man,\\non attaining to heaven. Men scorched by mental grief, or suffering under\\nbodily pain, feel as much refreshed in the companionship of their wives\\nas a perspiring person in a cool bath. No man, even in anger, should\\never do anything that is disagreeable to his wife, seeing that\\nhappiness, joy, and virtue,--everything dependeth on the wife. A wife is\\nthe sacred field in which the husband is born himself. Even Rishis\\ncannot create creatures without women. What happiness is greater than\\nwhat the father feeleth when the son running towards him, even though\\nhis body be covered with dust, claspeth his limbs? Why then dost thou\\ntreat with indifference such a son, who hath approached thee himself and\\nwho casteth wistful glances towards thee for climbing thy knees? Even\\nants support their own eggs without destroying them; then why shouldst\\nnot thou, a virtuous man that thou art, support thy own child? The touch\\nof soft sandal paste, of women, of (cool) water is not so agreeable as\\nthe touch of one\\'s own infant son locked in one\\'s embrace. As a Brahmana\\nis the foremost of all bipeds, a cow, the foremost of all quadrupeds, a\\nprotector, the foremost of all superiors, so is the son the foremost of\\nall objects, agreeable to the touch. Let, therefore, this handsome child\\ntouch thee in embrace. There is nothing in the world more agreeable to\\nthe touch than the embrace of one\\'s son. O chastiser of foes, I have\\nbrought forth this child, O monarch, capable of dispelling all thy\\nsorrows after bearing him in my womb for full three years. O monarch of\\nPuru\\'s race, \\'He shall perform a hundred horse-sacrifices\\'--these were\\nthe words uttered from the sky when I was in the lying-in room. Indeed,\\nmen going into places remote from their homes take up there others\\'\\nchildren on their laps and smelling their heads feel great happiness.\\nThou knowest that Brahmanas repeat these Vedic mantras on the occasion\\nof the consecrating rites of infancy.--Thou art born, O son, of my body!\\nThou art sprung from my heart. Thou art myself in the form of a son.\\nLive thou to a hundred years! My life dependeth on thee, and the\\ncontinuation of my race also, on thee. Therefore, O son, live thou in\\ngreat happiness to a hundred years. He hath sprung from thy body, this\\nsecond being from thee! Behold thyself in thy son, as thou beholdest thy\\nimage in the clear lake. As the sacrificial fire is kindled from the\\ndomestic one, so hath this one sprung from thee. Though one, thou hast\\ndivided thyself. In course of hunting while engaged in pursuit of the\\ndeer, I was approached by thee, O king, I who was then a virgin in the\\nasylum of my father. Urvasi, Purvachitti, Sahajanya, Menaka, Viswachi\\nand Ghritachi, these are the six foremost of Apsaras. Amongst them\\nagain, Menaka, born of Brahman, is the first. Descending from heaven on\\nEarth, after intercourse with Viswamitra, she gave birth to me. That\\ncelebrated Apsara, Menaka, brought me forth in a valley of Himavat.\\nBereft of all affection, she went away, cast me there as if I were the\\nchild of somebody else. What sinful act did I do, of old, in some other\\nlife that I was in infancy cast away by my parents and at present am\\ncast away by thee! Put away by thee, I am ready to return to the refuge\\nof my father. But it behoveth thee not to cast off this child who is thy\\nown.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Hearing all this, Dushmanta said, \"O Sakuntala, I do not know having\\nbegot upon thee this son. Women generally speak untruths. Who shall\\nbelieve in thy words? Destitute of all affection, the lewd Menaka is thy\\nmother, and she cast thee off on the surface of the Himavat as one throws\\naway, after the worship is over, the flowery offering made to his gods.\\nThy father too of the Kshatriya race, the lustful Viswamitra, who was\\ntempted to become a Brahmana, is destitute of all affection. However,\\nMenaka is the first of Apsaras, and thy father also is the first of Rishis.\\nBeing their daughter, why dost thou speak like a lewd woman? Thy words\\ndeserve no credit. Art thou not ashamed to speak them, especially before\\nme? Go hence, O wicked woman in ascetic guise. Where is that foremost of\\ngreat Rishis, where also is that Apsara Menaka? And why art thou, low as\\nthou art, in the guise of an ascetic? Thy child too is grown up. Thou\\nsayest he is a boy, but he is very strong. How hath he soon grown like a\\nSala sprout? Thy birth is low. Thou speakest like a lewd woman. Lustfully\\nhast thou been begotten by Menaka. O woman of ascetic guise, all that thou\\nsayest is quite unknown to me. I don\\'t know thee. Go withersoever thou\\nchoosest.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Sakuntala replied, \"Thou seest, O king, the fault of others, even though\\nthey be as small as a mustard seed. But seeing, thou noticest not thy own\\nfaults even though they be as large as the Vilwa fruit. Menaka is one of\\nthe celestials. Indeed, Menaka is reckoned as the first of celestials. My\\nbirth, therefore, O Dushmanta, is far higher than thine. Thou walkest upon\\nthe Earth, O king, but I roam in the skies! Behold, the difference between\\nourselves is as that between (the mountain) Meru and a mustard seed!\\nBehold my power, O king! I can repair to the abodes of Indra, Kuvera, Yama,\\nand Varuna! The saying is true which I shall refer to before thee, O\\nsinless one! I refer to it for example\\'s sake and not from evil motives.\\nTherefore, it behoveth thee to pardon me after thou hast heard it. An ugly\\nperson considereth himself handsomer than others until he sees his own\\nface in the mirror. But when he sees his own ugly face in the mirror, it\\nis then that he perceiveth the difference between himself and others. He\\nthat is really handsome never taunts anybody. And he that always talketh\\nevil becometh a reviler. And as the swine always look for dirt and filth\\neven when in the midst of a flower-garden, so the wicked always choose the\\nevil out of both evil and good that others speak. Those, however, that are\\nwise, on hearing the speeches of others that are intermixed with both good\\nand evil, accept only what is good, like geese that always extract the\\nmilk only, though it be mixed with water. As the honest are always pained\\nat speaking ill of others, so do the wicked always rejoice in doing the\\nsame thing. As the honest always feel pleasure in showing regard for the\\nold, so do the wicked always take delight in aspersing the good. The\\nhonest are happy in not seeking for faults. The wicked are happy in\\nseeking for them. The wicked ever speak ill of the honest. But the latter\\nnever injure the former, even if injured by them. What can be more\\nridiculous in the world than that those that are themselves wicked should\\nrepresent the really honest as wicked? When even atheists are annoyed with\\nthose that have fallen off from truth and virtue and who are really like\\nangry snakes of virulent poison, what shall I say of myself who am\\nnurtured in faith? He that having begotten a son who is his own image,\\nregardeth him not, never attaineth to the worlds he coveteth, and verily\\nthe gods destroy his good fortune and possessions. The Pitris have said\\nthat the son continueth the race and the line and is, therefore, the best\\nof all religious acts. Therefore, none should abandon a son. Manu hath\\nsaid that there are five kinds of sons: those begotten by one\\'s self upon\\nhis own wife, those obtained (as gift) from others, those purchased for a\\nconsideration, those reared with affection and those begotten upon other\\nwomen than upon wedded wives. Sons support the religion and achievements\\nof men, enhance their joys, and rescue deceased ancestors from hell. It\\nbehoveth thee not, therefore, O tiger among kings, to abandon a son who is\\nsuch. Therefore, O lord of Earth, cherish thy own self, truth, and virtue\\nby cherishing thy son. O lion among monarchs, it behoveth thee not to\\nsupport this deceitfulness. The dedication of a tank is more meritorious\\nthan that of a hundred wells. A sacrifice again is more meritorious than\\nthe dedication of a tank. A son is more meritorious than a sacrifice.\\nTruth is more meritorious than a hundred sons. A hundred horse-sacrifices\\nhad once been weighed against Truth, and Truth was found heavier than a\\nhundred horse-sacrifices. O king, Truth, I ween, may be equal to the study\\nof the entire Vedas and ablutions in all holy places. There is no virtue\\nequal to Truth: there is nothing superior to Truth. O king, Truth is God\\nhimself; Truth is the highest vow. Therefore, violate not thy pledge, O\\nmonarch! Let Truth and thee be even united. If thou placest no credit in\\nmy words, I shall of my own accord go hence. Indeed, thy companionship\\nshould be avoided. But thou, O Dushmanta, that when thou art gone, this\\nson of mine shall rule the whole Earth surrounded by the four seas and\\nadorned with the king of the mountains.\"\\'',\n",

But as soon as she had left, a voice from the\\nskies, emanating from no visible shape, thus spoke unto Dushmanta as he\\nwas sitting surrounded by his occasional and household priests, his\\npreceptors, and ministers. And the voice said, \"The mother is but the\\nsheath of flesh; the son sprung from the father is the father himself.\\nTherefore, O Dushmanta, cherish thy son, and insult not Sakuntala. O best\\nof men, the son, who is but a form of one\\'s own seed, rescueth (ancestors)\\nfrom the region of Yama. Thou art the progenitor of this boy. Sakuntala\\nhath spoken the truth. The husband, dividing his body in twain, is born\\nof his wife in the form of son. Therefore, O Dushmanta, cherish, O monarch,\\nthy son born of Sakuntala. To live by forsaking one\\'s living son is a\\ngreat misfortune. Therefore, O thou of Puru\\'s race, cherish thy high-\\nsouled son born of Sakuntala--And because this child is to be cherished by\\nthee even at our word, therefore shall this thy son be known by the name\\nof Bharata (the cherished).\" Hearing these words uttered by the dwellers\\nin heaven, the monarch of Puru\\'s race became overjoyed and spoke as\\nfollows unto his priests and ministers, \"Hear ye these words uttered by\\nthe celestial messenger? I myself know this one to be my son. If I had\\ntaken him as my son on the strength of Sakuntala\\'s words alone, my people\\nwould have been suspicious and my son also would not have been regarded as\\npure.\"',\n",

And the king smelt his child\\'s head and hugged\\nhim with affection. And the Brahmanas began to utter blessings upon him\\nand the bards began to applaud him. And the monarch then experienced the\\ngreat delight that one feeleth at the touch of one\\'s son. And Dushmanta\\nalso received that wife of his with affection. And he told her these\\nwords, pacifying her affectionately, \"O goddess, my union with thee took\\nplace privately. Therefore, I was thinking of how best to establish thy\\npurity. My people might think that we were only lustfully united and not\\nas husband and wife, and therefore, this son that I would have installed\\nas my heir apparent would only have been regarded as one of impure birth.\\nAnd dearest, every hard word thou hast uttered in thy anger, have I, O\\nlarge-eyed one, forgiven thee. Thou art my dearest!\" And the royal sage\\nDushmanta, having spoken thus unto his dear wife, O Bharata, received her\\nwith offerings of perfume, food, and drink. And king Dushmanta, then,\\nbestowed the name of Bharata upon his child, and formally installed him as\\nthe heir apparent. And the famous and bright wheels of Bharata\\'s car,\\ninvincible and like unto the wheels of the cars owned by the gods,\\ntraversed every region, filling the whole Earth with their rattle. And the\\nson of Dushmanta reduced to subjection all kings of the Earth. And he\\nruled virtuously and earned great fame. And that monarch of great prowess\\nwas known by the titles of Chakravarti and Sarvabhauma. And he performed\\nmany sacrifices like Sakra, the lord of the Maruts. And Kanwa was the\\nchief priest at those sacrifices, in which the offerings to Brahmanas were\\ngreat. And the blessed monarch performed both the cow and the horse-\\nsacrifices. And Bharata gave unto Kanwa a thousand gold coins as the\\nsacerdotal fee. It is that Bharata from whom have emanated so many mighty\\nachievements. It is from him that the great race called after him in his\\nrace are called after him. And in the Bharata race there have been born\\nmany godlike monarchs gifted with great energy, and like unto Brahman\\nhimself. Their number cannot be counted.

Do you help me\\ntherein.\" To him his eldest son born of Devayani then said, \"What needest\\nthou, O king? Dost thou want to have your youth?\" Yayati then told him,\\n\"Accept thou my decrepitude, O son! With thy youth I would enjoy myself.\\nDuring the time of a great sacrifice I have been cursed by the Muni\\nUsanas (Sukra). O son, I would enjoy myself with your youth. Take any of\\nyou this my decrepitude and with my body rule ye my kingdom. I would\\nenjoy myself with a renovated body. Therefore, ye my sons, take ye my\\ndecrepitude.\" But none of his sons accepted his decrepitude. Then his\\nyoungest son Puru said unto him, \"O king, enjoy thyself thou once again\\nwith a renovated body and returned youth! I shall take thy decrepitude\\nand at thy command rule thy kingdom.\" Thus addressed, the royal sage, by\\nvirtue of his ascetic power then transferred his own decrepitude unto\\nthat high-souled son of his and with the youth of Puru became a youth;\\nwhile with the monarch\\'s age Puru ruled his kingdom.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Then, after a thousand years had passed away, Yayati, that tiger among\\nkings, remained as strong and powerful as a tiger. And he enjoyed for a\\nlong time the companionship of his two wives. And in the gardens of\\nChitraratha (the king of Gandharvas), the king also enjoyed the company of\\nthe Apsara Viswachi. But even after all this, the great king found his\\nappetites unsatiated. The king, then recollected the following truths\\ncontained in the Puranas, \"Truly, one\\'s appetites are never satiated by\\nenjoyment. On the other hand, like sacrificial butter poured into the fire,\\nthey flame up with indulgence. Even if one enjoyed the whole Earth with\\nits wealth, diamonds and gold, animals and women, one may not yet be\\nsatiated. It is only when man doth not commit any sin in respect of any\\nliving thing, in thought, deed, or speech, it is then that he attaineth to\\npurity as that of Brahman. When one feareth nothing, when one is not\\nfeared by anything, when one wisheth for nothing, when one injureth\\nnothing, it is then that one attaineth to the purity of Brahman.\" The wise\\nmonarch seeing this and satisfied that one\\'s appetites are never satiated,\\nset his mind at rest by meditation, and took back from his son his own\\ndecrepitude. And giving him back his youth, though his own appetites were\\nunsatiated, and installing him on the throne, he spoke unto Puru thus,\\n\"Thou art my true heir, thou art my true son by whom my race is to be\\ncontinued. In the world shall my race be known by thy name.\"\\'',\n",
       " '\"Vaisampayana continued, \\'Then that tiger among kings, having installed\\nhis son Puru on the throne, went away to the mount of Bhrigu for devoting\\nhimself to asceticism. And, having acquired great ascetic merit, after\\nlong years, he succumbed to the inevitable influence of Time. He left his\\nhuman body by observing the vow of fasting, and ascended to heaven with\\nhis wives.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Between the celestials and the Asuras, there happened, of yore, frequent\\nencounters for the sovereignty of the three worlds with everything in them.\\nThe gods, then, from desire of victory, installed the son of Angiras\\n(Vrihaspati) as their priest to conduct their sacrifices; while their\\nopponents installed the learned Usanas as their priest for the same\\npurpose. And between those two Brahmanas there are always much boastful\\nrivalry. Those Danavas assembled for encounter that were slain by the gods\\nwere all revived by the seer Sukra by the power of his knowledge. And then\\nstarting again, into life,--these fought with the gods. The Asuras also\\nslew on the field of battle many of the celestials. But the open-minded\\nVrihaspati could not revive them, because he knew not the science called\\nSanjivani (re-vivification) which Kavya endued with great energy knew so\\nwell. And the gods were, therefore, in great sorrow. And the gods, in\\ngreat anxiety of heart and entertaining a fear of the learned Usanas, then\\nwent to Kacha, the eldest son of Vrihaspati, and spoke unto him, saying,\\n\"We pay court to thee, be kind to us and do us a service that we regard as\\nvery great. That knowledge which resides in Sukra, that Brahmana of\\nimmeasurable prowess, make thy own as soon as thou canst. Thou shalt find\\nthe Brahmana in the court of Vrishaparvan. He always protects the Danavas\\nbut never us, their opponents. Thou art his junior in age, and, therefore,\\ncapable of adoring him with reverence. Thou canst also adore Devayani, the\\nfavourite daughter of that high-souled Brahmana. Indeed, thou alone art\\ncapable of propitiating them both by worship. There is none else that can\\ndo so. By gratifying Devayani with thy conduct, liberality, sweetness, and\\ngeneral behaviour, thou canst certainly obtain that knowledge.\" The son of\\nVrihaspati, thus solicited by the gods, said \"So be it,\" and went to where\\nVrishaparvan was. Kacha, thus sent by the gods, soon went to the capital\\nof the chief of the Asuras, and beheld Sukra there. And beholding him, he\\nthus spoke unto him, \"Accept me as thy disciple. I am the grandson of the\\nRishi Angiras and son of Vrihaspati. By name I am known as Kacha. Thyself\\nbecoming my preceptor, I shall practise the Brahmacharya mode of life for\\na thousand years. Command me, then, O Brahmana!\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Sukra (hearing this) said, \\'Welcome art thou, O Kacha! I accept thy\\nspeech. I will treat thee with regard; for by so doing, it is Vrihaspati\\nwho will be regarded.\\'',\n",
       " '\"Vaisampayana continued, \\'Kacha commanded by Kavya or Usanas himself,\\ncalled also Sukra, then said, \"So be it,\" and took the vow he had spoken\\nof. And, O Bharata, accepting the vow of which he had spoken, at the\\nproper time, Kacha began to conciliate regardfully both his preceptor and\\n(his daughter) Devayani. Indeed, he began to conciliate both. And as he\\nwas young, by singing and dancing and playing on different kinds of\\ninstruments, he soon gratified Devayani who was herself in her youth. And,\\nO Bharata, with his whole heart set upon it, he soon gratified the maiden\\nDevayani who was then a young lady, by presents of flowers and fruits and\\nservices rendered with alacrity. And Devayani also with her songs and\\nsweetness of manners used, while they were alone, to attend upon that\\nyouth carrying out his vow. And when five hundred years had thus passed of\\nKacha\\'s vow, the Danavas came to learn his intention. And having no\\ncompunctions about slaying a Brahmana, they became very angry with him.\\nAnd one day they saw Kacha in a solitary part of the woods engaged in\\ntending (his preceptor\\'s) kine. They then slew Kacha from their hatred of\\nVrihaspati and also from their desire of protecting the knowledge of\\nreviving the dead from being conveyed by him. And having slain him, they\\nhacked his body into pieces and gave them to be devoured by jackals and\\nwolves. And (when twilight came) the kine returned to the fold without him\\nwho tended them. And Devayani, seeing the kine returned from the woods\\nwithout Kacha, spoke, O Bharata, unto her father thus:',\n",
       " '\"\\'\"Thy evening-fire hath been kindled. The Sun also hath set, O father! The\\nkine have returned without him who tendeth them. Kacha is, indeed, not to\\nbe seen. It is plain that Kacha hath been lost, or is dead. Truly do I say,\\nO father, that without him I will not live.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Sukra hearing this said, \"I will revive him by saying, \\'Let this one\\ncome.\\'\" Then having recourse to the science of reviving the dead, Sukra\\nsummoned Kacha. And summoned by his preceptor, Kacha appeared before him\\nin the gladness of heart tearing by virtue of his preceptor\\'s science\\nthe bodies of the wolves (that had devoured him). And asked about the\\ncause of his delay, he thus spoke unto Bhargava\\'s daughter. Indeed,\\nasked by that Brahman\\'s daughter, he told her, \"I was dead. O thou of\\npure manners, burdened with sacrificial fuel, Kusa grass, and logs of\\nwood, I was coming towards our abode. I sat under a banian tree. The\\nkine also, having been brought together, were staying under the shade\\nof that same banian tree. The Asuras, beholding me, asked \\'Who art\\nthou?\\' They heard me answer, \\'I am the son of Vrihaspati.\\' As soon as\\nI said this, the Danavas slew me, and hacking my body into pieces gave\\nmy remains to jackals and wolves. And they then went home in the\\ngladness of heart. O amiable one, summoned by the high-souled\\nBhargava, I after all come before thee fully revived.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'On another occasion, asked by Devayani, the Brahmana Kacha went into the\\nwoods. And as he was roving about for gathering flowers, the Danavas\\nbeheld him. They again slew him, and pounding him into a paste they mixed\\nit with the water of the ocean. Finding him long still (in coming), the\\nmaiden again represented the matter unto her father. And summoned again by\\nthe Brahmana with the aid of his science, Kacha appearing before his\\npreceptor and his daughter told everything as it had happened. Then\\nslaying him for the third time and burning him and reducing him to ashes,\\nthe Asuras gave those ashes to the preceptor himself, mixing them with his\\nwine. And Devayani again spoke unto her father, saying, \"O father, Kacha\\nwas sent to gather flowers. But he is not to be seen. It is plain he hath\\nbeen lost, or has died. I tell thee truly, I would not live without him.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Sukra hearing this said, \"O daughter, the son of Vrihaspati hath gone to\\nthe region of the dead. Though revived by my science, he is thus slain\\nfrequently.

But Kacha, summoned with the aid of science, and afraid\\nof the consequence to his preceptor, feebly replied from within the\\nstomach of his preceptor, saying, \"Be graceful unto me, O lord!

But when a disciple behaveth disrespectfully, he should never be\\nforgiven by the preceptor if the latter is really desirous of benefiting\\nthe former. Therefore, I do not desire to live any longer in a country\\nwhere evil behaviour is at a premium. The wise man desirous of good,\\nshould not dwell among those sinfully inclined men who always speak ill of\\ngood behaviour and high birth. But there should one live,--indeed, that\\nhath been said to be the best of dwelling places,--where good behaviour\\nand purity of birth are known and respected. The cruel words uttered by\\nVrishaparvan\\'s daughter burn my heart even as men, desirous of kindling a\\nfire, burn the dry fuel. I do not think anything more miserable for a man\\nin the three worlds than to adore one\\'s enemies blessed with good fortune,\\nhimself possessing none.

He may truly be said to dwell in the woods having an\\ninhabited place near to himself. Again a wise man withdrawn from all\\nearthly objects, might live in a hamlet leading the life of a hermit. He\\nmay never exhibit the pride of family, birth or learning. Clad in the\\nscantiest robes, he may yet regard himself as attired in the richest\\nvestments.

And Pratipa married Sunanda, the daughter of Sivi, and begat upon\\nher three sons, viz., Devapi, Santanu and Valhika. And Devapi, while still\\na boy, entered the woods as a hermit.

       " '\"\\'And Santanu married Ganga, who bore him a son Devavrata who was\\nafterwards called Bhishma. And Bhishma, moved by the desire of doing good\\nto his father, got him married to Satyavati who was also called Gandhakali.\\nAnd in her maidenhood she had a son by Parasara, named Dwaipayana. And\\nupon her Santanu begat two other sons named Chitrangada and Vichitravirya.\\nAnd before they attained to majority, Chitrangada had been slain by the\\nGandharvas. But Vichitravirya became king, and married the two daughters\\nof the king of Kasi, named Amvika and Amvalika. But Vichitravirya died\\nchildless. Then Satyavati began to think as to how the dynasty of\\nDushmanta might be perpetuated. Then she recollected the Rishi Dwaipayana.\\nThe latter coming before her, asked, \"What are thy commands?\" She said,\\n\"Thy brother Vichitravirya hath gone to heaven childless. Beget virtuous\\nchildren for him.\" Dwaipayana, consenting to this, begat three children,\\nviz., Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura. King Dhritarashtra had a hundred\\nsons by his wife, Gandhari, in consequence of the boon granted by\\nDwaipayana. And amongst those hundred sons of Dhritarashtra, four became\\ncelebrated. They are Duryodhana, Duhsasana, Vikarna, and Chitrasena. And\\nPandu had two jewels of wives, viz., Kunti, also called Pritha, and Madri.\\nOne day Pandu, while out a-hunting, saw a deer covering its mate. That was\\nreally a Rishi in the form of a deer. Seeing the deer in that attitude, he\\nkilled it with his arrows, before its desire was gratified. Pierced with\\nthe king\\'s arrow, the deer quickly changed its form and became a Rishi,\\nand said unto Pandu, \"O Pandu, thou art virtuous and acquainted also with\\nthe pleasure derived from the gratification of one\\'s desire. My desire\\nunsatisfied, thou hast slain me! Therefore, thou also, when so engaged and\\nbefore thou art gratified, shalt die!\" Pandu, hearing this curse, became\\npale, and from that time would not go in unto his wives. And he told them\\nthese words, \"Through my own fault, I have been cursed! But I have heard\\nthat for the childless there are no regions hereafter.\" Therefore, he\\nsolicited Kunti to have offspring raised for him. And Kunti said, \"Let it\\nbe.\" So she raised up offspring. By Dharma she had Yudhishthira; by Maruta,\\nBhima: and by Sakra, Arjuna. And Pandu, well-pleased with her, said, \"This\\nthy co-wife is also childless. Therefore, cause her also to bear children.\"\\nKunti saying, \"So be it,\" imparted unto Madri the mantra of invocation.\\nAnd on Madri were raised by the twin Aswins, the twins Nakula and Sahadeva.\\nAnd (one day) Pandu, beholding Madri decked with ornaments, had his desire\\nkindled. And, as soon as he touched her, he died. Madri ascended the\\nfuneral pyre with her lord. And she said unto Kunti, \"Let these twins of\\nmine be brought up by thee with affection.\" After some time those five\\nPandavas were taken by the ascetics of the woods to Hastinapura and there\\nintroduced to Bhishma and Vidura. And after introducing them, the ascetics\\ndisappeared in the very sight of all. And after the conclusion of the\\nspeech of those ascetics, flowers were showered down upon the spot, and\\nthe celestial drums also were beaten in the skies. The Pandavas were then\\ntaken (by Bhishma). They then represented the death of their father and\\nperformed his last honours duly. And as they were brought up there,\\nDuryodhana became exceedingly jealous of them. And the sinful Duryodhana\\nacting like Rakshasa tried various means to drive them away. But what must\\nbe can never be frustrated. So all Duryodhana\\'s efforts proved futile.\\nThen Dhritarashtra sent them, by an act of deception to Varanavata, and\\nthey went there willingly. There an endeavour was made to burn them to\\ndeath; but it proved abortive owing to the warning counsels of Vidura.\\nAfter that the Pandavas slew Hidimva, and then they went to a town called\\nEkachakra. There also they slew a Rakshasa of the name of Vaka and then\\nwent to Panchala. And there obtaining Draupadi for a wife they returned to\\nHastinapura. And there they dwelt for some time in peace and begat\\nchildren. And Yudhishthira begat Prativindhya; Bhima, Sutasoma; Arjuna,\\nSrutakriti; Nakula, Satanika; and Sahadeva, Srutakarman. Besides these,\\nYudhishthira, having obtained for his wife Devika, the daughter of\\nGovasana of the Saivya tribe, in a self-choice ceremony, begat upon her a\\nson named Yaudheya. And Bhima also obtaining for a wife Valandhara, the\\ndaughter of the king of Kasi, offered his own prowess as dower and begat\\nupon her a son named Sarvaga. And Arjuna also, repairing to Dwaravati,\\nbrought away by force Subhadra, the sweet-speeched sister of Vasudeva, and\\nreturned in happiness to Hastinapura. And he begat upon her a son named\\nAbhimanyu endued with all accomplishments and dear to Vasudeva himself.\\nAnd Nakula obtaining for his wife Karenumati, the princess of Chedi, begat\\nupon her a son named Niramitra. And Sahadeva also married Vijaya, the\\ndaughter of Dyutimat, the king of Madra, obtaining her in a self-choice\\nceremony and begat upon her a son named Suhotra. And Bhimasena had some\\ntime before begat upon Hidimva a son named Ghatotkacha. These are the\\neleven sons of the Pandavas. Amongst them all, Abhimanyu was the\\nperpetuator of the family. He married Uttara, the daughter of Virata, who\\nbrought forth a dead child whom Kunti took up on her lap at the command of\\nVasudeva who said, \"I will revive this child of six months.\" And though\\nborn before time, having been burnt by the fire of Aswatthaman\\'s weapon\\nand, therefore, deprived of strength and energy he was revived by Vasudeva\\nand endued with strength, energy and prowess. And after reviving him,\\nVasudeva said, \"Because this child hath been born in an extinct race,\\ntherefore, he shall be called Parikshit.\" And Parikshit married Madravati,\\nthy mother, O king, and thou art born to her, O Janamejaya!

He was truthful and guileless, and\\nlike the king of the celestials himself conversant with the dictates of\\nvirtue. And from the combination in him of liberality, religion and\\nasceticism, he acquired a great good fortune. He was free from anger and\\nmalice, and was handsome in person like Soma himself. In splendour he was\\nlike the Sun and in impetuosity of valour like Vayu. In wrath he was like\\nYama, and in patience like the Earth. And, O king, while Santanu ruled the\\nearth, no deer, boars, birds, or other animals were needlessly slain. In\\nhis dominions the great virtue of kindness to all creatures prevailed, and\\nthe king himself, with the soul of mercy, and void of desire and wrath,\\nextended equal protection unto all creatures. Then sacrifices in honour of\\nthe gods, the Rishis, and Pitris commenced, and no creature was deprived\\nof life sinfully. And Santanu was the king and father of all--of those\\nthat were miserable and those that had no protectors, of birds and beasts,\\nin fact, of every created thing. And during the rule of the best of Kurus--\\nof that king of kings--speech became united with truth, and the minds of\\nmen were directed towards liberality and virtue. And Santanu, having\\nenjoyed domestic felicity for six and thirty years, retired into the woods.',\n",
       " '\"\\'And Santanu\\'s son, the Vasu born of Ganga, named Devavrata resembled\\nSantanu himself in personal beauty, in habits and behaviour, and in\\nlearning. And in all branches of knowledge worldly or spiritual his skill\\nwas very great. His strength and energy were extraordinary. He became a\\nmighty car-warrior. In fact he was a great king.',\n",
       " '\"\\'One day, while pursuing along the banks of the Ganges a deer that he had\\nstruck with his arrow, king Santanu observed that the river had become\\nshallow. On observing this, that bull among men, viz., Santanu, began to\\nreflect upon this strange phenomenon. He mentally asked why that first of\\nrivers ran out so quickly as before. And while seeking for a cause, the\\nillustrious monarch beheld that a youth of great comeliness, well-built\\nand amiable person, like Indra himself, had, by his keen celestial weapon,\\nchecked the flow of the river. And the king, beholding this extraordinary\\nfeat of the river Ganga having been checked in her course near where that\\nyouth stood, became very much surprised. This youth was no other than\\nSantanu\\'s son himself. But as Santanu had seen his son only once a few\\nmoments after his birth, he had not sufficient recollection to identify\\nthat infant with the youth before his eyes. The youth, however, seeing his\\nfather, knew him at once, but instead of disclosing himself, he clouded\\nthe king\\'s perception by his celestial powers of illusion and disappeared\\nin his very sight.',\n",
       " '\"\\'King Santanu, wondering much at what he saw and imagining the youth to be\\nhis own son then addressed Ganga and said, \"Show me that child.\" Ganga\\nthus addressed, assuming a beautiful form, and holding the boy decked with\\nornaments in her right arm, showed him to Santanu. And Santanu did not\\nrecognise that beautiful female bedecked with ornaments and attired in\\nfine robes of white, although he had known her before. And Ganga said, \"O\\ntiger among men, that eighth son whom thou hadst some time before begat\\nupon me is this. Know that this excellent child is conversant with all\\nweapons. O monarch, take him now. I have reared him with care. And go home,\\nO tiger among men, taking him with thee. Endued with superior intelligence,\\nhe has studied with Vasishtha the entire Vedas with their branches.\\nSkilled in all weapons and a mighty bowman, he is like Indra in battle.\\nAnd, O Bharata, both the gods and the Asuras look upon him with favour.\\nWhatever branches of knowledge are known to Usanas, this one knoweth\\ncompletely. And so is he the master of all those Sastras that the son of\\nAngiras (Vrihaspati) adored by the gods and the Asuras, knoweth. And all\\nthe weapons known to the powerful and invincible Rama, the son of\\nJamadagni are known to this thy son of mighty arms. O king of superior\\ncourage, take this thy own heroic child given unto thee by me. He is a\\nmighty bowman and conversant with the interpretation of all treatises on\\nthe duties of a king.\" Thus commanded by Ganga, Santanu took his child\\nresembling the Sun himself in glory and returned to his capital. And\\nhaving reached his city that was like unto the celestial capital, that\\nmonarch of Puru\\'s line regarded himself greatly fortunate. And having\\nsummoned all the Pauravas together, for the protection of his kingdom he\\ninstalled his son as his heir-apparent. And O bull of Bharata\\'s race, the\\nprince soon gratified by his behaviour his father and the other members of\\nthe Paurava race: in fact, all the subjects of the kingdom. And the king\\nof incomparable prowess lived happily with that son of his.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Four years had thus passed away, when the king one day went into the\\nwoods on the bank of the Yamuna. And while the king was rambling there, he\\nperceived a sweet scent coming from an unknown direction. And the monarch,\\nimpelled by the desire of ascertaining the cause, wandered hither and\\nthither. And in course of his ramble, he beheld a black-eyed maiden of\\ncelestial beauty, the daughter of a fisherman. The king addressing her,\\nsaid, \"Who art thou, and whose daughter? What dost thou do here, O timid\\none?\" She answered, \"Blest be thou! I am the daughter of the chief of the\\nfishermen. At his command, I am engaged for religious merit, in rowing\\npassengers across this river in my boat.\" And Santanu, beholding that\\nmaiden of celestial form endued with beauty, amiableness, and such\\nfragrance, desired her for his wife. And repairing unto her father, the\\nking solicited his consent to the proposed match. But the chief of the\\nfishermen replied to the monarch, saying, \"O king, as soon as my daughter\\nof superior complexion was born, it was of course, understood that she\\nshould be bestowed upon a husband. But listen to the desire I have\\ncherished all along in my heart. O sinless one, thou art truthful: if thou\\ndesirest to obtain this maiden as a gift from me, give me then this\\npledge. If, indeed, thou givest the pledge, I will of course bestow my\\ndaughter upon thee for truly I can never obtain a husband for her equal to\\nthee.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Santanu, hearing this, replied, \"When I have heard of the pledge thou\\naskest, I shall then say whether I would be able to grant it. If it is\\ncapable of being granted, I shall certainly grant it. Otherwise how shall\\nI grant it.\" The fisherman said, \"O king, what I ask of thee is this: the\\nson born of this maiden shall be installed by thee on thy throne and none\\nelse shall thou make thy successor.\"\\'',\n",
       " '\"Vaisampayana continued, \\'O Bharata, when Santanu heard this, he felt no\\ninclination to grant such a boon, though the fire of desire sorely burnt\\nhim within. The king with his heart afflicted by desire returned to\\nHastinapura, thinking all the way of the fisherman\\'s daughter. And having\\nreturned home, the monarch passed his time in sorrowful meditation. One\\nday, Devavrata approaching his afflicted father said, \"All is prosperity\\nwith thee; all chiefs obey thee; then how is it that thou grievest thus?\\nAbsorbed in thy own thoughts, thou speakest not a word to me in reply.\\nThou goest not out on horse-back now; thou lookest pale and emaciated,\\nhaving lost all animation. I wish to know the disease thou sufferest from,\\nso that I may endeavour to apply a remedy.\" Thus addressed by his son,\\nSantanu answered, \"Thou sayest truly, O son, that I have become melancholy.\\nI will also tell thee why I am so. O thou of Bharata\\'s line, thou art the\\nonly scion of this our large race. Thou art always engaged in sports of\\narms and achievements of prowess. But, O son, I am always thinking of the\\ninstability of human life. If any danger overtake thee, O child of Ganga,\\nthe result is that we become sonless. Truly thou alone art to me as a\\ncentury of sons. I do not, therefore, desire to wed again. I only desire\\nand pray that prosperity may ever attend thee so that our dynasty may be\\nperpetuated. The wise say that he that hath one son hath no son.\\nSacrifices before fire and the knowledge of the three Vedas yield, it is\\ntrue, everlasting religious merit, but all these, in point of religious\\nmerit, do not come up to a sixteenth part of the religious merit\\nattainable on the birth of a son. Indeed, in this respect, there is hardly\\nany difference between men and the lower animals. O wise one, I do not\\nentertain a shadow of doubt that one attains to heaven in consequence of\\nhis having begotten a son. The Vedas which constitute the root of the\\nPuranas and are regarded as authoritative even by the gods, contain\\nnumerous proof of this. O thou of Bharata\\'s race, thou art a hero of\\nexcitable temper, who is always engaged in the exercise of arms. It is\\nvery probable that thou wilt be slain on the field of battle. If it so\\nhappen, what then will be the state of the Bharata dynasty? It is this\\nthought that hath made me so melancholy. I have now told thee fully the\\ncauses of my sorrow.\"\\'',\n",
       " '\"Vaisampayana continued, \\'Devavrata who was endued with great intelligence,\\nhaving ascertained all this from the king, reflected within himself for a\\nwhile. He then went to the old minister devoted to his father\\'s welfare\\nand asked him about the cause of the king\\'s grief. O bull of Bharata\\'s\\nrace, when the prince questioned the minister, the latter told him about\\nthe boon that was demanded by the chief of the fishermen in respect of his\\ndaughter Gandhavati. Then Devavrata, accompanied by many Kshatriya chiefs\\nof venerable age, personally repaired to the chief of the fishermen and\\nbegged of him his daughter on behalf of the king. The chief of the\\nfishermen received him with due adorations, and, O thou of Bharata\\'s race,\\nwhen the prince took his seat in the court of the chief, the latter\\naddressed him and said, \"O bull among the Bharatas, thou art the first of\\nall wielders of weapons and the only son of Santanu. Thy power is great.\\nBut I have something to tell thee. If the bride\\'s father was Indra himself,\\neven then he would have to repent of rejecting such an exceedingly\\nhonourable and desirable proposal of marriage. The great man of whose seed\\nthis celebrated maiden named Satyavati was born, is, indeed, equal to you\\nin virtue. He hath spoken to me on many occasions of the virtues of thy\\nfather and told me that, the king alone is worthy of (marrying) Satyavati.\\nLet me tell you that I have even rejected the solicitations of that best\\nof Brahmarshis--the celestial sage Asita--who, too, had often asked for\\nSatyavati\\'s hand in marriage. I have only one word to say on the part of\\nthis maiden. In the matter of the proposed marriage there is one great\\nobjection founded on the fact of a rival in the person of a co-wife\\'s son.\\nO oppressor of all foes, he hath no security, even if he be an Asura or a\\nGandharva, who hath a rival in thee. There is this only objection to the\\nproposed marriage, and nothing else. Blest be thou! But this is all I have\\nto say in the matter of the bestowal or otherwise, of Satyavati.\"\\'',\n",
       " '\"Vaisampayana continued, \\'O thou of Bharata\\'s race, Devavrata, having\\nheard these words, and moved by the desire of benefiting his father thus\\nanswered in the hearing of the assembled chiefs, \"O foremost of truthful\\nmen, listen to the vow I utter! The man has not been or will not be born,\\nwho will have the courage to take such a vow! I shall accomplish all that\\nthou demandest! The son that may be born of this maiden shall be our\\nking.\" Thus addressed, the chief of the fishermen, impelled by desire of\\nsovereignty (for his daughter\\'s son), to achieve the almost impossible,\\nthen said, \"O thou of virtuous soul, thou art come hither as full agent on\\nbehalf of thy father Santanu of immeasurable glory; be thou also the sole\\nmanager on my behalf in the matter of the bestowal of this my daughter.\\nBut, O amiable one, there is something else to be said, something else to\\nbe reflected upon by thee. O suppressor of foes, those that have daughters,\\nfrom the very nature of their obligations, must say what I say. O thou\\nthat art devoted to truth, the promise thou hast given in the presence of\\nthese chiefs for the benefit of Satyavati, hath, indeed, been worthy of\\nthee. O thou of mighty arms, I have not the least doubt of its ever being\\nviolated by thee. But I have my doubts in respect of the children thou\\nmayst beget.\"\\'',\n",
       " '\"Vaisampayana continued, \\'O king, the son of Ganga, devoted to truth,\\nhaving ascertained the scruples of the chief of the fishermen, then said,\\nmoved thereto by the desire of benefiting his father, \"Chief of fishermen,\\nthou best of men, listen to what I say in the presence of these assembled\\nkings. Ye kings, I have already relinquished my right to the throne, I\\nshall now settle the matter of my children.

       " '\"Vaisampayana continued, \\'Upon these words of the son of Ganga, the hair\\non the fisherman\\'s body stood on end from glee, and he replied, \"I bestow\\nmy daughter!\" Immediately after, the Apsaras and the gods with diverse\\ntribes of Rishis began to rain down flowers from the firmament upon the\\nhead of Devavrata and exclaimed, \"This one is Bhishma (the terrible).\"\\nBhishma then, to serve his father, addressed the illustrious damsel and\\nsaid, \"O mother, ascend this chariot, and let us go unto our house.\"\\'',\n",
       " '\"Vaisampayana continued, \\'Having said this, Bhishma helped the beautiful\\nmaiden into his chariot. On arriving with her at Hastinapura, he told\\nSantanu everything as it had happened. And the assembled kings, jointly\\nand individually, applauded his extraordinary act and said, \"He is really\\nBhishma (the terrible)!\" And Santanu also, hearing of the extraordinary\\nachievements of his son, became highly gratified and bestowed upon the\\nhigh-souled prince the boon of death at will, saying, \"Death shall never\\ncome to thee as long as thou desirest to live.

       " '\"Vaisampayana said, \\'O monarch, after the nuptials were over, king Santanu\\nestablished his beautiful bride in his household. Soon after was born of\\nSatyavati an intelligent and heroic son of Santanu named Chitrangada. He\\nwas endued with great energy and became an eminent man. The lord Santanu\\nof great prowess also begat upon Satyavati another son named Vichitravirya,\\nwho became a mighty bowman and who became king after his father. And\\nbefore that bull among men, viz., Vichitravirya, attained to majority, the\\nwise king Santanu realised the inevitable influence of Time. And after\\nSantanu had ascended to heaven, Bhishma, placing himself under the command\\nof Satyavati, installed that suppressor of foes, viz., Chitrangada, on the\\nthrone, who, having soon vanquished by his prowess all monarchs,\\nconsidered not any man as his equal. And beholding that he could vanquish\\nmen, Asuras, and the very gods, his namesake, the powerful king of the\\nGandharvas, approached him for an encounter. Between that Gandharva and\\nthat foremost one of the Kurus, who were both very powerful, there\\noccurred on the field of Kurukshetra a fierce combat which lasted full\\nthree years on the banks of the Saraswati. In that terrible encounter\\ncharacterised by thick showers of weapons and in which the combatants\\nground each other fiercely, the Gandharva, who had greater prowess or\\nstrategic deception, slew the Kuru prince. Having slain Chitrangada--that\\nfirst of men and oppressor of foes--the Gandharva ascended to heaven. When\\nthat tiger among men endued with great prowess was slain, Bhishma, the son\\nof Santanu, performed, O king, all his obsequies. He then installed the\\nboy Vichitravirya of mighty arms, still in his minority, on the throne of\\nthe Kurus. And Vichitravirya, placing himself under the command of Bhishma,\\nruled the ancestral kingdom. And he adored Santanu\\'s son Bhishma who was\\nconversant with all the rules of religion and law; so, indeed, Bhishma\\nalso protected him that was so obedient to the dictates of duty.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"Vaisampayana said, \\'O thou of Kuru\\'s race, after Chitrangada was slain,\\nhis successor Vichitravirya being a minor, Bhishma ruled the kingdom,\\nplacing himself under the command of Satyavati. When he saw that his\\nbrother, who was the foremost of intelligent men, attained to majority,\\nBhishma set his heart upon marrying Vichitravirya. At this time he heard\\nthat the three daughters of the king of Kasi, all equal in beauty to the\\nApsaras themselves, would be married on the same occasion, selecting their\\nhusbands at a self-choice ceremony. Then that foremost of car-warriors,\\nthat vanquisher of all foes, at the command of his mother, went to the\\ncity of Varanasi in a single chariot. There Bhishma, the son of Santanu,\\nsaw that innumerable monarchs had come from all directions; and there he\\nalso saw those three maidens that would select their own husbands. And\\nwhen the (assembled) kings were each being mentioned by name, Bhishma\\nchose those maidens (on behalf of his brother). And taking them upon his\\nchariot, Bhishma, that first of smiters in battle, addressed the kings, O\\nmonarch, and said in a voice deep as the roar of the clouds, \"The wise\\nhave directed that when an accomplished person has been invited, a maiden\\nmay be bestowed on him, decked with ornaments and along with many valuable\\npresents. Others again may bestow their daughters by accepting a couple of\\nkine. Some again bestow their daughters by taking a fixed sum, and some\\ntake away maidens by force. Some wed with the consent of the maidens, some\\nby drugging them into consent, and some by going unto the maidens\\' parents\\nand obtaining their sanction. Some again obtain wives as presents for\\nassisting at sacrifices. Of these, the learned always applaud the eighth\\nform of marriage. Kings, however, speak highly of the Swyamvara (the fifth\\nform as above) and themselves wed according to it. But the sages have said\\nthat, that wife is dearly to be prized who is taken away by force, after\\nthe slaughter of opponents, from amidst the concourse of princes and kings\\ninvited to a self-choice ceremony. Therefore, ye monarchs, I bear away\\nthese maidens hence by force. Strive ye, to the best of your might, to\\nvanquish me or to be vanquished. Ye monarchs, I stand here resolved to\\nfight!\" The Kuru prince, endued with great energy, thus addressing the\\nassembled monarchs and the king of Kasi, took upon his car those maidens.\\nAnd having taken them up, he sped his chariot away, challenging the\\ninvited kings to a fight.',\n",
       " '\"\\'The challenged monarchs then all stood up, slapping their arms and biting\\ntheir nether lips in wrath. And loud was the din produced, as, in a great\\nhurry, they began to cast off their ornaments and put on their armour. And\\nthe motion of their ornaments and armour, O Janamejaya, brilliant as these\\nwere, resembled meteoric flashes in the sky. And with brows contracted and\\neyes red with rage, the monarchs moved in impatience, their armour and\\nornaments dazzling or waving with their agitated steps. The charioteers\\nsoon brought handsome cars with fine horses harnessed thereto. Those\\nsplendid warriors then, equipped with all kinds of weapons, rode on those\\ncars, and with uplifted weapons pursued the retreating chief of the Kurus.\\nThen, O Bharata, occurred the terrible encounter between those innumerable\\nmonarchs on one side and the Kuru warrior alone on the other. And the\\nassembled monarchs threw at their foe ten thousand arrows at the same time.\\nBhishma, however speedily checked those numberless arrows before they\\ncould come at him by means of a shower of his own arrows as innumerable as\\nthe down on the body. Then those kings surrounded him from all sides and\\nrained arrows on him like masses of clouds showering on the mountain-\\nbreast. But Bhishma, arresting with his shafts the course of that arrowy\\ndownpour, pierced each of the monarchs with three shafts. The latter, in\\ntheir turn pierced Bhishma, each with five shafts. But, O king, Bhishma\\nchecked those by his prowess and pierced each of the contending kings with\\ntwo shafts. The combat became so fierce with that dense shower of arrows\\nand other missiles that it looked very much like the encounter between the\\ncelestials and the Asuras of old, and men of courage who took no part in\\nit were struck with fear even to look at the scene. Bhishma cut off, with\\nhis arrows, on the field of battle, bows, and flagstaffs, and coats of\\nmail, and human heads by hundreds and thousands. And such was his terrible\\nprowess and extraordinary lightness of hand, and such the skill with which\\nhe protected himself, that the contending car-warriors, though his enemies,\\nbegan to applaud him loudly. Then that foremost of all wielders of weapons\\nhaving vanquished in battle all those monarchs, pursued his way towards\\nthe capital of the Bharatas, taking those maidens with him.',\n",
       " '\"\\'It was then, O king, that mighty car-warrior, king Salya of immeasurable\\nprowess, from behind summoned Bhishma, the son of Santanu, to an encounter.\\nAnd desirous of obtaining the maidens, he came upon Bhishma like a mighty\\nleader of a herd of elephants rushing upon another of his kind, and\\ntearing with his tusks the latter\\'s hips at the sight of a female elephant\\nin heat. And Salya of mighty arms, moved by wrath addressed Bhishma and\\nsaid, \"Stay, Stay.\" Then Bhishma, that tiger among men, that grinder of\\nhostile armies, provoked by these words, flamed up in wrath like a blazing\\nfire. Bow in hand, and brow furrowed into wrinkles, he stayed on his car,\\nin obedience to Kshatriya usage having checked its course in expectation\\nof the enemy. All the monarchs seeing him stop, stood there to become\\nspectators of the coming encounter between him and Salya. The two then\\nbegan to exhibit their prowess (upon each other) like roaring bulls of\\ngreat strength at the sight of a cow in rut. Then that foremost of men,\\nking Salya covered Bhishma, the son of Santanu with hundreds and thousands\\nof swift-winged shafts. And those monarchs seeing Salya thus covering\\nBhishma at the outset with innumerable shafts, wondered much and uttered\\nshouts of applause. Beholding his lightness of hand in combat, the crowd\\nof regal spectators became very glad and applauded Salya greatly. That\\nsubjugator of hostile towns, Bhishma, then, on hearing those shouts of the\\nKshatriyas, became very angry and said, \"Stay, Stay.\" In wrath, he\\ncommanded his charioteer, saying, \"Lead thou my car to where Salya is, so\\nthat I may slay him instantly as Garuda slays a serpent.\" Then the Kuru\\nchief fixed the Varuna weapon on his bow-string, and with it afflicted the\\nfour steeds of king Salya. And, O tiger among kings, the Kuru chief, then,\\nwarding off with his weapons those of his foe, slew Salya\\'s charioteer.\\nThen that first of men, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, fighting for the sake\\nof those damsels, slew with the Aindra weapon the noble steeds of his\\nadversary.

And when everything about the\\nwedding had been settled by Bhishma in consultation with Satyavati, the\\neldest daughter of the king of Kasi, with a soft smile, told him these\\nwords, \"At heart I had chosen the king of Saubha for my husband.

As he was conversant with the rules of virtue, he consulted with the\\nBrahmanas who had mastered the Vedas, and permitted Amba, the eldest\\ndaughter of the ruler of Kasi to do as she liked. But he bestowed with due\\nrites the two other daughters, Ambika and Ambalika on his younger brother\\nVichitravirya. And though Vichitravirya was virtuous and abstemious, yet,\\nproud of youth and beauty, he soon became lustful after his marriage. And\\nboth Ambika and Ambalika were of tall stature, and of the complexion of\\nmolten gold. And their heads were covered with black curly hair, and their\\nfinger-nails were high and red; their hips were fat and round, and their\\nbreasts full and deep. And endued with every auspicious mark, the amiable\\nyoung ladies considered themselves to be wedded to a husband who was every\\nway worthy of themselves, and extremely loved and respected Vichitravirya.\\nAnd Vichitravirya also, endued with the prowess of the celestials and the\\nbeauty of the twin Aswins, could steal the heart of any beautiful woman.\\nAnd the prince passed seven years uninterruptedly in the company of his\\nwives. He was attacked while yet in the prime of youth, with phthisis.\\nFriends and relatives in consultation with one another tried to effect a\\ncure. But in spite of all efforts, the Kuru prince died, setting like the\\nevening sun.

O punisher of foes, act in such a way that the\\nlineal link may not be broken and our friends and relatives may not\\ngrieve.\" Thus urged by the miserable and weeping Satyavati speaking such\\nwords inconsistent with virtue from grief at the loss of her son, Bhishma\\naddressed her again and said, \"O Queen, turn not thy eyes away from virtue.\\nO, destroy us not. Breach of truth by a Kshatriya is never applauded in\\nour treatises on religion. I shall soon tell thee, O Queen, what the\\nestablished Kshatriya usage is to which recourse may be had to prevent\\nSantanu\\'s line becoming extinct on earth. Hearing me, reflect on what\\nshould be done in consultation with learned priests and those that are\\nacquainted with practices allowable in times of emergency and distress,\\nforgetting not at the same time what the ordinary course of social conduct\\nis.\"\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Bhishma continued, \"In olden days, Rama, the son of Jamadagni, in anger\\nat the death of his father, slew with his battle axe the king of the\\nHaihayas. And Rama, by cutting off the thousand arms of Arjuna (the\\nHaihaya king), achieved a most difficult feat in the world. Not content\\nwith this, he set out on his chariot for the conquest of the world, and\\ntaking up his bow he cast around his mighty weapons to exterminate the\\nKshatriyas. And the illustrious scion of Bhrigu\\'s race, by means of his\\nswift arrows annihilated the Kshatriya tribe one and twenty times.',\n",
       " '\"\\'\"And when the earth was thus deprived of Kshatriyas by the great Rishi,\\nthe Kshatriya ladies all over the land had offspring raised by Brahmanas\\nskilled in the Vedas. It has been said in the Vedas that the sons so\\nraised belongeth to him that had married the mother. And the Kshatriya\\nladies went in unto the Brahamanas not lustfully but from motives of\\nvirtue. Indeed, it was thus that the Kshatriya race was revived.',\n",
       " '\"\\'\"In this connection there is another old history that I will recite to\\nyou. There was in olden days a wise Rishi of the name of Utathya. He had a\\nwife of the name Mamata whom he dearly loved. One day Utathya\\'s younger\\nbrother Vrihaspati, the priest of the celestials, endued with great energy,\\napproached Mamata. The latter, however, told her husband\\'s younger\\nbrother--that foremost of eloquent men--that she had conceived from her\\nconnection with his elder brother and that, therefore, he should not then\\nseek for the consummation of his wishes. She continued, \\'O illustrious\\nVrihaspati, the child that I have conceived hath studied in his mother\\'s\\nwomb the Vedas with the six Angas, Semen tuum frustra perdi non potest. How\\ncan then this womb of mine afford room for two children at a time?\\nTherefore, it behoveth thee not to seek for the consummation of thy desire\\nat such a time.\\' Thus addressed by her, Vrihaspati, though possessed of\\ngreat wisdom, succeeded not in suppressing his desire. Quum auten jam cum\\nilla coiturus esset, the child in the womb then addressed him and said, \\'O\\nfather, cease from thy attempt. There is no space here for two. O\\nillustrious one, the room is small. I have occupied it first. Semen tuum\\nperdi non potest. It behoveth thee not to afflict me.\\' But Vrihaspati\\nwithout listening to what that child in the womb said, sought the embraces\\nof Mamata possessing the most beautiful pair of eyes. Ille tamen Muni qui\\nin venture erat punctum temporis quo humor vitalis jam emissum iret\\nprovidens, viam per quam semen intrare posset pedibus obstruxit. Semen ita\\nexhisum, excidit et in terram projectumest. And the illustrious\\nVrihaspati, beholding this, became indignant, and reproached Utathya\\'s\\nchild and cursed him, saying, \\'Because thou hast spoken to me in the way\\nthou hast at a time of pleasure that is sought after by all creatures,\\nperpetual darkness shall overtake thee.\\' And from this curse of the\\nillustrious Vrishaspati Utathya\\'s child who was equal unto Vrihaspati in\\nenergy, was born blind and came to be called Dirghatamas (enveloped in\\nperpetual darkness). And the wise Dirghatamas, possessed of a knowledge\\nof the Vedas, though born blind, succeeded yet by virtue of his learning,\\nin obtaining for a wife a young and handsome Brahmana maiden of the name\\nof Pradweshi. And having married her, the illustrious Dirghatamas, for the\\nexpansion of Utathya\\'s race, begat upon her several children with Gautama\\nas their eldest. These children, however, were all given to covetousness\\nand folly. The virtuous and illustrious Dirghatamas possessing complete\\nmastery over the Vedas, soon after learnt from Surabhi\\'s son the practices\\nof their order and fearlessly betook himself to those practices, regarding\\nthem with reverence. (For shame is the creature of sin and can never be\\nwhere there is purity of intention). Then those best of Munis that dwelt\\nin the same asylum, beholding him transgress the limits of propriety\\nbecame indignant, seeing sin where sin was not. And they said, \\'O, this\\nman, transgresseth the limit of propriety. No longer doth he deserve a\\nplace amongst us. Therefore, shall we all cast this sinful wretch off.\\'\\nAnd they said many other things regarding the Muni Dirghatamas. And his\\nwife, too, having obtained children, became indignant with him.',\n",
       " '\"\\'\"The husband then addressing his wife Pradweshi, said, \\'Why is it that\\nthou also hast been dissatisfied with me?\\' His wife answered, \\'The husband\\nis called the Bhartri because he supporteth the wife. He is called Pati\\nbecause he protecteth her. But thou art neither, to me! O thou of great\\nascetic merit, on the other hand, thou hast been blind from birth, it is I\\nwho have supported thee and thy children. I shall not do so in future.\\'',\n",
       " '\"\\'\"Hearing these words of his wife, the Rishi became indignant and said\\nunto her and her children, \\'Take me unto the Kshatriyas and thou shalt then\\nbe rich.\\' His wife replied (by saying), \\'I desire not wealth that may be\\nprocured by thee, for that can never bring me happiness. O best of\\nBrahmanas, do as thou likest. I shall not be able to maintain thee as\\nbefore.\\' At these words of his wife, Dirghatamas said, \\'I lay down from\\nthis day as a rule that every woman shall have to adhere to one husband\\nfor her life. Be the husband dead or alive, it shall not be lawful for a\\nwoman to have connection with another. And she who may have such\\nconnection shall certainly be regarded as fallen. A woman without husband\\nshall always be liable to be sinful. And even if she be wealthy she shall\\nnot be able to enjoy that wealth truly. Calumny and evil report shall ever\\ndog her.\\' Hearing these words of her husband Pradweshi became very angry,\\nand commanded her sons, saying, \\'Throw him into the waters of Ganga!\\' And\\nat the command of their mother, the wicked Gautama and his brothers, those\\nslaves of covetousness and folly, exclaiming, \\'Indeed, why should we\\nsupport this old man?\\' tied the Muni to a raft and committing him to the\\nmercy of the stream returned home without compunction. The blind old man\\ndrifting along the stream on that raft, passed through the territories of\\nmany kings. One day a king named Vali conversant with every duty went to\\nthe Ganges to perform his ablutions. And as the monarch was thus engaged,\\nthe raft to which the Rishi was tied, approached him. And as it came, the\\nking took the old man. The virtuous Vali, ever devoted to truth, then\\nlearning who the man was that was thus saved by him, chose him for raising\\nup offspring. And Vali said, \\'O illustrious one, it behoveth thee to raise\\nupon my wife a few sons that shall be virtuous and wise.\\' Thus addressed,\\nthe Rishi endued with great energy, expressed his willingness. Thereupon\\nking Vali sent his wife Sudeshna unto him. But the queen knowing that the\\nlatter was blind and old went not unto him, she sent unto him her nurse.\\nAnd upon that Sudra woman the virtuous Rishi of passions under full\\ncontrol begat eleven children of whom Kakshivat was the eldest. And\\nbeholding those eleven sons with Kakshivat as the eldest, who had studied\\nall the Vedas and who like Rishis were utterers of Brahma and were\\npossessed of great power, king Vali one day asked the Rishi saying, \\'Are\\nthese children mine?\\' The Rishi replied, \\'No, they are mine. Kakshivat and\\nothers have been begotten by me upon a Sudra woman. Thy unfortunate queen\\nSudeshna, seeing me blind and old, insulted me by not coming herself but\\nsending unto me, instead, her nurse.\\' The king then pacified that best of\\nRishis and sent unto him his queen Sudeshna. The Rishi by merely touching\\nher person said to her, \\'Thou shalt have five children named Anga, Vanga,\\nKalinga, Pundra and Suhma, who shall be like unto Surya (Sun) himself in\\nglory. And after their names as many countries shall be known on earth. It\\nis after their names that their dominions have come to be called Anga,\\nVanga, Kalinga, Pundra and Suhma.\\'',\n",
       " '\"\\'\"It was thus that the line of Vali was perpetuated, in days of old, by a\\ngreat Rishi.

The Rishi by his energy brought me under his complete\\ncontrol, and gratified his desire then and there, having first enveloped\\nthe region in a thick fog. Before this there was a revolting fishy odour\\nin my body; but the Rishi dispelled it and gave me my present fragrance.\\nThe Rishi also told me that by bringing forth his child in an island of\\nthe river, I would still continue (to be) a virgin. And the child of\\nParasara so born of me in my maidenhood hath become a great Rishi endued\\nwith large ascetic powers and known by the name of Dwaipayana (the island-\\nborn).

Satyavati,\\nbeholding him seated at his ease, after the usual inquiries, addressed him\\nand said, \"O learned one, sons derive their birth both from the father and\\nthe mother. They are, therefore, the common property of both parents.\\nThere cannot be the least doubt about it that the mother hath as much\\npower over them as the father.

    "## Part 2: Creating Baseline Language Models 📕\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're able to tokenize a corpus, it is time to start building language models (LM).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build three different language models. They all operate under the premise of assigning probabilities to sentences. Given a sentence – that is, a sequence of tokens $w = w_1\\ldots w_n$ – we want to be able to compute the **probability** that sentence is used: \n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sentences are built from tokens, and the likelihood that a token occurs where it does depends on the tokens before it. This points to using **conditional probability** to compute $P(w)$. That is, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "This is also called the **chain rule** for probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider the sentence \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><code>'when I drink Coke I smile'</code></center>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The probability that it occurs, according the the chain rule, is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink | when I})\\cdot P(\\text{Coke | when I drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when I drink Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile | when I drink Coke I})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the probability that the sentence occurs is the product of the probability that each subsequent token follows the tokens that came before. For example, the probability $P(\\text{Coke | when I drink})$ is likely pretty high, as Coke is something that you drink. The probability $P(\\text{pizza | when I drink})$ is likely low (if not 0), because pizza is not something that you drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder how the language model \"knows\" that Coke is something that you drink, but pizza is not. The way that the language model \"learns\" its probabilities is by **looking at examples of existing sentences**, i.e. by being **trained on a corpus**. Throughout Parts 2 and 3, you will look at **different ways of estimating these probabilities**. In each case, you will use a corpus to assign probabilities to different tokens and combinations of tokens, and use those probabilities to generate new sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each language model you build will be a **class** with a few methods in common:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `__init__` constructor: when you instantiate an LM object, you will need to pass the \"training corpus\" on which your model will be trained (i.e. a list of tokens you created in Question 2 with `tokenize`). The `train` method will then use that data to create a model which is saved in the `mdl` attribute. This code is given to you.\n",
    "* The `train` method takes in a list of tokens (e.g. the output of `tokenize`) and outputs a language model. **This language model is represented as a `Series`, whose index consists of tokens and whose values are the probabilities that the tokens occur.** (In the case of the N-Gram model in Part 3/Question 5, the model will be represented as a DataFrame instead of a Series – more on this later.)\n",
    "* The `probability` method takes in a sequence of tokens and returns the probability that this sequence occurs under the language model.\n",
    "* The `sample` method takes in a positive integer `M` and generates a string made up of `M` tokens using the language model. **This method generates random sentences!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The description of Question 3 walks through in detail how each of these methods work. However, here's the general workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{initialize LM with tokenized corpus} \\rightarrow \\text{train LM (i.e. assign probabilities to each token) using corpus} \\rightarrow \\text{used trained LM to compute probabilities of input sentences and generate random sentences}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Questions 3, 4, and 5, you will create classes for different language models – uniform, unigram, and N-Gram, respectively. In each class, you will implement each of the above methods."

    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's recap what we've done so far. Recall the chain rule for probability, where $w$ is a sentence made up of tokens $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Questions 3 (Uniform) and 4 (Unigram), your `train` methods computed these probabilities **unconditionally**, meaning that the probability that a token appeared in a sentence did **not depend** on the other tokens around it. That is, you said $P(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i - 1}) = P(w_i)$. In Question 3, you let $P(w_i) = \\frac{1}{\\text{# unique tokens in corpus}}$, and in Question 4, you let $P(w_i) = \\frac{\\text{# tokens in corpus equal to $w_i$}}{\\text{# tokens in corpus}}$. Cruciually, each probability was determined by looking at the corpus that the model was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-Gram Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will build an N-Gram language model, in which the probability of a token appearing in a sentence **does depend** on the tokens that come before it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule above specifies that the probability that a token occurs at in a particular position in a sentence depends on **all** previous tokens in the sentence. However, it is often the case that the likelihood that a token appears in a sentence is influenced more by **nearby** tokens. (Remember, tokens are words, punctuation, or `'\\x02'` / `'\\x03'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-Gram language model relies on the assumption that only nearby tokens matter. Specifically, it assumes that the probability that a token occurs depends only on the previous $N-1$ tokens, rather than all previous tokens. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1}) = P(w_n|w_{n-(N-1)},\\ldots,w_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In an N-Gram language model, there is a hyperparameter that we get to choose when creating the model, $N$. For any $N$, the resulting N-Gram model looks at the previous $N-1$ tokens when computing probabilities. (Note that the unigram model you built in Question 4 is really an N-Gram model with $N=1$, since it looked at 0 previous tokens when computing probabilities.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Trigram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When $N=3$, we have a \"trigram\" model. Such a model looks at the previous $N-1 = 2$ tokens when computing probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the tuple `('when', 'I', 'drink', 'Coke', 'I', 'smile')`, corresponding to the sentence `'when I drink Coke I smile'`. Under the trigram model, the probability of this sentence is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile}) = P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink | when I}) \\cdot P(\\text{Coke | I drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | drink Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile | Coke I})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The trigram model doesn't consider the beginning of the sentence when computing the probability that the sentence ends in `'smile'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### N-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "Both when working with a training corpus and when implementing the `probability` method to compute the probabilities of other sentences, you will need to work with \"chunks\" of $N$ tokens at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The **N-Grams of a text** are a list of tuples containing sliding windows of length $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the trigrams in the sentence `'when I drink Coke I smile'` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "[('when', 'I', 'drink'), ('I', 'drink', 'Coke'), ('drink', 'Coke', 'I'), ('Coke', 'I', 'smile')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computing N-Gram Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in our trigram model above, we computed $P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile})$ as being the product of several conditional probabilities. These conditional probabilities are the result of **training** our N-Gram model on a training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an N-Gram model, we must compute a conditional probability for every $N$-token sequence in the corpus. For instance, suppose again that we are training a trigram model. Then, for every 3-token sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$, we must compute $P(w_3 | w_1, w_2)$. To do so, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_3 | w_1, w_2) = \\frac{C(w_1, w_2, w_3)}{C(w_1, w_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C(w_1, w_2, w_3)$ is the number of occurrences of the trigram sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$ in the training corpus and $C(w_1, w_2)$ is the number of occurrences of the bigram sequence  $w_1, w_2$ in the training corpus. (Technical note: the probabilities that we compute using the ratios of counts are _estimates_ of the true conditional probabilities of N-Grams in the population of corpuses from which our corpus was drawn.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for any $N$, conditional probabilities are computed by dividing the counts of N-Grams by the counts of the (N-1)-Grams they follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In the description of Question 5.2 we provide a detailed example of how we might compute such probabilities.**\n",

    "The `NGramLM` class contains a few extra methods and attributes beyond those of `UniformLM` and `UnigramLM`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiating `NGramLM` requires both a list of tokens and a positive integer `N`, specifying the N in N-grams. This parameter is stored in an attribute `N`.\n",
    "1. The `NGramLM` class has a method `create_ngrams` that takes in a list of tokens and returns a list of N-Grams (recall from above, an N-Gram is a **tuple** of length N). This list of N-Grams is then passed to the `train` method to train the N-Gram model.\n",
    "1. While the `train` method still creates a language model (in this case, an N-Gram model) and stores it in the `mdl` attribute, this model is most naturally stored as a DataFrame. This DataFrame will have three columns:\n",
    "    - `'ngram'`, containing the N-Grams found in the text.\n",
    "    - `'n1gram'`, containing the (N-1)-Grams upon which the N-Grams in `ngram` are built.\n",
    "    - `'prob'`, containing the probabilities of each N-Gram in `ngram`.\n",
    "1. The `NGramLM` class has an attribute `prev_mdl` that stores an (N-1)-Gram language model over the same corpus (which in turn will store an (N-2)-Gram language model over the same corpus, and so on). This is necessary to compute the probability that a word occurs at the start of a text. This code is included for you in the constructor."

    "\n",
    "<a name='question5d'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method you implemented in the `UniformLM` and `UnigramLM` classes was `sample`, which gave you a way of generating new sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will implement the `sample` method in the `NGramLM` class. It should take in a positive integer `M` and generate a string of M tokens using the trained language model. It should begin with a starting token `'\\x02'`, then generate subsequent tokens from the probabilities in `self.mdl` and continue picking words conditional on the previous choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate how sampling works using a small concrete example. Suppose our corpus and **trigram** model are defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">>> short_corpus = 'zebras eat green peas \\n\\n cows eat green grass \\n\\n zebras eat green peppers'\n",
    ">>> short_tokens = tokenize(short_corpus)\n",
    ">>> short_tokens\n",
    "['\\x02', 'zebras', 'eat', 'green', 'peas', '\\x03', '\\x02', 'cows', 'eat', 'green', 'grass', '\\x03', '\\x02', 'zebras', 'eat', 'green', 'peppers', '\\x03']\n",
    ">>> grass_model = NGramLM(3, short_tokens)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are told to execute `grass_model.sample(5)`. Here's how we'd proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. The first character in the output is `'\\x02'`, as specified above. **We won't count `'\\x02'` in the length of our output string**, so we still need to find 5 more tokens.\n",
    "1. The next character needs to be either `'zebras'` or `'cows'`, since `('\\x02', 'zebras')` and `('\\x02', 'cows')` are the only **bigrams** in `short_tokens` that start with an `'\\x02'`. $P(\\text{zebras | \\x02})$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $P(\\text{cows | \\x02})$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, so we select either `'zebras'` or `'cows'` for our next token according to these probabilities. For the sake of example, suppose we select `'cows'`. 4 more tokens to go.\n",
    "2. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('\\x02', 'cows')`. There is just one, `('\\x02', 'cows', 'eat')`, so our next token must be `'eat'`. 3 more tokens to go.\n",
    "3. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('cows', 'eat')`. Again, there is just one, `('cows', 'eat', 'green')`, so our next token must be `'green'`. 2 more tokens to go.\n",
    "4. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('eat', 'green')`. There are three options – `('eat', 'green', 'peas')`, `('eat', 'green', 'grass')`, and `('eat', 'green', 'peppers')`. Since $P(\\text{peas | eat green}) = P(\\text{grass | eat green}) = P(\\text{peppers | eat green}) = \\frac{1}{3}$, we pick either `'peas'`, `'grass'`, or `'peppers'` uniformly at random. For the sake of example, suppose we select `'peppers'`. 1 more token to go.\n",
    "5. We must end the output string now with `'\\x03'`, putting us at `'\\x02'` plus 5 tokens, which is the number of tokens we were told to sample. Note that `'\\x03'` **does** count towards the number of tokens we were asked to sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our result is `'\\x02 cows eat green peppers \\x03'`. **Note that in our training corpus we never encountered an instance of cows 🐄 eating green peppers 🫑, but we were able to generate a coherent sentence in which they did – pretty cool!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidance:\n",
    "- If you run into a situation where there are no N-Grams that match the most recent (N-1)-Gram, you should add `'\\x03'` (STOP) token as the next token in your output sentence. There is a chance that your sampled sentence ends in many `'\\x03'`s, and that's fine.\n",
    "- Helper functions and recursion will be very helpful.\n",
